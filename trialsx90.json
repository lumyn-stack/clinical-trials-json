  "POPULATION": "Adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection",
  "POPULATION_DETAILS": "Hospitalized adults with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical or radiographic evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement were enrolled at 60 sites in North America, Europe, and Asia. Disease severity at baseline was classified using an eight-category ordinal scale: most patients had severe disease, defined by need for supplemental oxygen, noninvasive or invasive ventilatory support, oxygen saturation ≤94% on room air, or tachypnea. At enrollment, 13.0% were hospitalized without oxygen but required ongoing medical care (ordinal 4), 41.0% required low-flow oxygen (ordinal 5), 18.2% required high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation (ordinal 6), and 26.8% were on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO (ordinal 7). Median time from symptom onset to randomization was 9 days, and most patients had at least one comorbidity such as HTN, obesity, or T2DM.",
  "INTERVENTION": "IV remdesivir up to 10 days plus standard care",
  "INTERVENTION_DETAILS": "Remdesivir was administered intravenously as a 200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg IV once daily on days 2 through 10 or until hospital discharge or death, whichever occurred first. Dosing was given in a blinded fashion with matching placebo volumes, and all patients received local standard supportive care. Use of other Covid-19–directed therapies was allowed only if supported by written institutional policies or guidelines; otherwise, off-label or experimental antivirals or immunomodulators were prohibited from day 1 through day 29.",
  "COMPARISON": "IV placebo plus standard care",
  "COMPARISON_DETAILS": "Placebo infusions matched remdesivir in schedule and volume and were given for up to 10 days or until discharge or death. At most sites a matching opaque infusion was used; at some European and non-European sites normal saline served as placebo with opaque bags and tubing to preserve blinding. All patients received the local hospital standard of care, and use of additional Covid-19–specific treatments followed the same policy-based restrictions as in the remdesivir arm.",
  "OUTCOME": "Time to recovery by day 29",
  "OUTCOME_DETAILS": "The primary outcome was time to recovery, defined as the first day within 28 days after enrollment on which a patient reached category 1, 2, or 3 on the eight-category ordinal scale (1, not hospitalized with no activity limitations; 2, not hospitalized with activity limitation or home oxygen; 3, hospitalized without oxygen and no longer needing ongoing medical care). The key secondary outcome was clinical status on the ordinal scale at day 15. Other important secondary outcomes included mortality by days 15 and 29, time to improvement of one and two ordinal categories, duration of hospitalization, days receiving various levels of respiratory support, incidence of new oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, or mechanical ventilation/ECMO, and safety endpoints including grade 3–4 and serious adverse events.",

  "BOTTOMLINE": "In hospitalized adults with Covid-19 and lower respiratory tract involvement, IV remdesivir significantly shortened time to recovery compared with placebo, with the largest apparent benefit among patients on low-flow oxygen at baseline. Mortality was numerically lower with remdesivir but not definitively reduced, and benefits were less clear in patients already requiring high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, or mechanical ventilation/ECMO.",

  ],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, no antiviral therapy had demonstrated clinical efficacy, and management of hospitalized patients was largely supportive. ACTT-1 was the first large, blinded, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial to show that an antiviral (remdesivir) could improve clinical outcomes by shortening time to recovery in hospitalized patients with Covid-19, particularly those requiring conventional oxygen. These findings underpinned emergency use authorization and subsequent full approval of remdesivir in many countries and helped shift practice away from unproven agents toward evidence-based antiviral therapy.\n\nSubsequent randomized trials and meta-analyses have generally confirmed that remdesivir improves recovery time and reduces progression to more intensive respiratory support, while having little or no clear effect on overall mortality, especially in critically ill patients. Current major guidelines, including the final 2024 NIH Covid-19 Treatment Guidelines and the 2022 IDSA Covid-19 guidelines, recommend remdesivir for hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19 (typically those requiring supplemental oxygen but not yet on invasive ventilation or ECMO), often in combination with corticosteroids, and for select high-risk outpatients early in disease. Later evidence from large open-label studies that did not show a mortality benefit has tempered initial expectations, and guideline panels now view remdesivir as a modest but clinically useful therapy for selected hospitalized and high-risk ambulatory patients rather than a stand-alone solution.",
  "INCLUSION": "Adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19, evidence of lower respiratory tract infection",
  "EXCLUSION": null,
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Primary endpoint was changed mid-trial from ordinal clinical status at day 15 to time to recovery by day 29, which, although justified by evolving knowledge, raises concerns about outcome switching; Mortality differences favored remdesivir but were not statistically definitive, and the trial was not primarily powered to detect modest effects on death; Benefit appeared concentrated in patients on low-flow oxygen, with little clear advantage among those already on high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, or mechanical ventilation/ECMO, limiting extrapolation to the sickest patients; Background therapies such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine varied by site based on local policies, introducing heterogeneity in concomitant treatment; The population was enrolled early in the pandemic before widespread vaccination and emergence of later variants, so applicability to current vaccinated populations and newer viral strains is uncertain; Subsequent large pragmatic trials and systematic reviews have suggested that remdesivir provides limited or no mortality benefit, which has led some commentators to question the clinical importance of its effect on time to recovery alone."

  "POPULATION": "Consecutive outpatients presenting to the ED with clinically suspected acute PE",
  "POPULATION_DETAILS": "Adults presenting to the ED in 19 European centers with an acute onset or worsening of dyspnea or chest pain without another obvious etiology, in whom clinicians had a clinical suspicion of PE. Patients were managed using a standardized diagnostic algorithm incorporating a pretest probability score (simplified, revised Geneva score or 2-level Wells score), high-sensitivity quantitative D-dimer testing, and CTPA when indicated.",
  "INTERVENTION": "Diagnostic strategy using age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff plus clinical probability to rule out PE",
  "INTERVENTION_DETAILS": "All consecutive ED outpatients with suspected PE underwent clinical probability assessment using either the simplified, revised Geneva score or the 2-level Wells score. Patients with high/likely clinical probability proceeded directly to CTPA. In patients with low or intermediate (nonhigh) or unlikely clinical probability, a high-sensitivity quantitative D-dimer assay was performed. For patients younger than 50 years, a D-dimer <500 µg/L was considered negative. For patients 50 years or older, an age-adjusted cutoff defined as age×10 µg/L (fibrin equivalent units) was used; a value below this cutoff was considered negative. Six validated high-sensitivity assays were allowed (including ELISA-derived and immunoturbidimetric tests). Patients with a negative D-dimer by this age-adjusted rule had PE considered ruled out, did not undergo CTPA, received no anticoagulation for PE, and were followed for 3 months for symptomatic VTE.",
  "COMPARISON": "Conventional fixed D-dimer cutoff strategy (500 µg/L) plus clinical probability",
  "COMPARISON_DETAILS": "The conceptual comparator was the standard diagnostic strategy using a fixed D-dimer cutoff of 500 µg/L combined with clinical probability assessment. In this standard approach, patients with low or intermediate/unlikely clinical probability and a D-dimer <500 µg/L would be considered to have PE ruled out without imaging and would not receive anticoagulation, whereas patients with D-dimer ≥500 µg/L would proceed to CTPA. In the study cohort, outcomes and diagnostic yield for this conventional cutoff were estimated from the same prospectively enrolled population by identifying the subgroup with D-dimer <500 µg/L.",
  "OUTCOME": "Failure rate of the diagnostic strategy using an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff (3‑month symptomatic VTE among untreated patients with negative age-adjusted D-dimer).",
  "OUTCOME_DETAILS": "The primary endpoint was the 3‑month failure rate of the diagnostic strategy, defined as the proportion of patients with adjudicated symptomatic VTE (proximal DVT or PE involving a segmental or more proximal pulmonary artery, or PE-related death) during 3‑month follow-up among patients who were not treated with anticoagulants because PE was ruled out on the basis of a negative age-adjusted D-dimer result. Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with nonhigh/unlikely clinical probability in whom PE could be ruled out using the age-adjusted D-dimer (overall and specifically in patients ≥75 y), the proportion with D-dimer between 500 µg/L and the age-adjusted cutoff, and the 3‑month thromboembolic risk within this subgroup.",
  "INTERVENTION_N": "1154",
  "COMPARISON_N": "817",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "ADJUST-PE was a single-arm management outcome study without randomized diagnostic strategies. For purposes of PICO and outcome tabulation, the intervention arm is defined as patients managed with the age-adjusted D-dimer strategy (1154 nonhigh/unlikely probability patients with a negative age-adjusted D-dimer). The comparison arm is defined conceptually within the same cohort as those who would have been classified as D-dimer negative using the conventional fixed cutoff of 500 µg/L (817 nonhigh/unlikely probability patients with D-dimer <500 µg/L). No separate randomized control group was used; comparative outcomes and diagnostic yield for the conventional cutoff are inferred from these subgroups within the prospectively enrolled population.",
  "CLINICALQUESTION": "In ED outpatients with suspected acute PE and low or intermediate/unlikely clinical probability, does using an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff (age×10 µg/L for patients ≥50 y) to rule out PE safely increase the proportion of patients spared imaging and anticoagulation compared with the conventional fixed D-dimer cutoff of 500 µg/L?",
  "CLINICALQUESTION_simple": "In ED patients with suspected PE and nonhigh clinical probability, does an age-adjusted D-dimer strategy safely improve diagnostic yield compared with the standard fixed cutoff?",
  "BOTTOMLINE": "In ED outpatients with suspected PE and low or intermediate/unlikely clinical probability, a diagnostic strategy combining clinical probability assessment with an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff allowed more patients—particularly those ≥75 y—to have PE ruled out without imaging or anticoagulation, with a very low 3‑month rate of symptomatic VTE among those left untreated. Compared with the conventional fixed 500 µg/L cutoff, this approach substantially improved diagnostic yield while maintaining safety consistent with accepted thresholds for PE diagnostic strategies.",

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before ADJUST-PE, clinicians recognized that D-dimer specificity falls sharply with age, leading to many false positives and unnecessary CTPA scans in older patients, despite D-dimer’s high sensitivity for ruling out VTE. Age-adjusted cutoffs had been derived and retrospectively validated, but there was concern about safely withholding imaging and anticoagulation in elderly patients based solely on a higher D-dimer threshold. ADJUST-PE provided the first large prospective management validation showing that an age-adjusted D-dimer (age×10 µg/L in patients ≥50 y), when combined with structured clinical probability assessment, can safely exclude PE while substantially increasing the proportion of older patients who avoid imaging and anticoagulation.\n\nFollowing ADJUST-PE, major guidelines such as the 2014 and 2019 ESC acute PE guidelines, the 2018 ACEP clinical policy on acute venous thromboembolism, and VTE diagnostic guidance from hematology and primary-care societies incorporated or endorsed age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds for outpatients over 50 with low or intermediate/unlikely pretest probability. Subsequent observational studies and meta-analyses have confirmed low failure rates and improved efficiency with age-adjusted D-dimer, and current recommendations generally regard this approach as safe and preferable to a fixed 500 µg/L cutoff in appropriate ED and outpatient populations, while still emphasizing that evidence is limited or absent in certain high-risk groups (inpatients, pregnancy, severe renal dysfunction).",
  "INCLUSION": "Adult outpatients, Presentation to the ED with acute onset or worsening dyspnea or chest pain, Clinical suspicion of PE, Availability for 3‑month follow-up",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Nonrandomized single-arm management design without a concurrent control group managed strictly with a 500 µg/L cutoff, limiting direct comparative inference; Use of two different clinical prediction rules (simplified, revised Geneva and 2-level Wells) and six different high-sensitivity D-dimer assays, introducing heterogeneity in pretest probability assessment and laboratory methods; Primary safety comparison to the conventional 500 µg/L cutoff is partly modelled within the same cohort rather than tested prospectively in parallel; Limited autopsy data among deaths during follow-up, so occult PE as a cause of death cannot be completely excluded despite adjudication; Study population restricted to European ED outpatients with a relatively high PE prevalence, which may limit generalizability to settings with lower prevalence, hospitalized patients, or other healthcare systems; Exclusion of patients with severe renal impairment, pregnancy, or very limited life expectancy restricts applicability of age-adjusted D-dimer in these high-risk groups; Cost-effectiveness, patient-centered outcomes, and implementation barriers (assay-specific cutoffs, EMR integration) were not directly evaluated; Editorials have noted that clinicians must ensure use of validated high-sensitivity assays and appropriate clinical probability tools when applying age-adjusted D-dimer, and that evidence remains limited for extrapolating this approach beyond carefully selected low or intermediate/unlikely risk patients."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Low-dose corticosteroids for septic shock have been debated for decades, with earlier high-dose regimens proving harmful and later low-dose trials suggesting faster shock reversal and possible mortality benefit in selected subgroups. ADRENAL was a large, pragmatic, international RCT in ventilated patients with septic shock that showed no reduction in 90-day mortality with continuous hydrocortisone infusion compared with placebo, but did demonstrate more rapid resolution of shock, shorter initial mechanical ventilation, shorter ICU stay, and fewer transfusions; alongside contrasting results from trials such as APROCCHSS, it shifted the focus of steroid therapy toward non-mortality benefits.\n\nCurrent Surviving Sepsis Campaign adult guidelines and contemporary critical care corticosteroid guidelines recommend IV hydrocortisone 200 mg/day for adults with septic shock who have an ongoing vasopressor requirement despite adequate fluid resuscitation, as a weak recommendation based on moderate- to low-quality evidence, emphasizing earlier shock reversal and increased vasopressor-free days without clear mortality benefit. Subsequent meta-analyses incorporating ADRENAL and related trials largely confirm a neutral effect on short- and long-term mortality but consistent improvements in shock resolution and ICU resource use, so ADRENAL remains central to guideline recommendations and supports using hydrocortisone selectively in refractory septic shock rather than for routine mortality benefit.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Confidence intervals around the primary outcome included both potential modest benefit and harm, so a small mortality effect cannot be excluded; Higher than anticipated withdrawal and loss to follow-up resulted in missing primary-outcome data for a minority of randomized patients; Use of open-label systemic corticosteroids in both groups may have diluted any treatment effect of the study drug; Appropriateness and timing of antimicrobial therapy and other sepsis bundle elements were not systematically adjudicated, limiting interpretation of co-interventions; Long-term neuromuscular weakness and other chronic steroid-related adverse effects were not rigorously assessed; The trial excluded patients with septic shock who were not mechanically ventilated and those with very prolonged shock or clearly imminent death, which may limit generalizability to all septic shock phenotypes; The continuous infusion hydrocortisone regimen may not directly apply to settings where intermittent bolus dosing is standard practice, and the optimal dosing, timing, and tapering strategy remain uncertain.",

AKIKI provided the first large, multicenter randomized evidence that a delayed, criteria-based strategy is not associated with higher short-term mortality than an early strategy, while sparing many patients from unnecessary RRT and related complications, and it helped counterbalance earlier signals of benefit from more aggressive early-initiation trials such as ELAIN.\n\nSubsequent multicenter trials, including IDEAL-ICU and STARRT-AKI, largely confirmed that routine early RRT initiation does not improve mortality compared with a more expectant approach in critically ill patients with severe AKI, and follow-up work such as AKIKI 2 suggested potential harm from very prolonged deferral beyond conventional thresholds. Current international guidance, including the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations and commentaries on the KDIGO AKI guideline, generally advises against initiating RRT in sepsis-associated AKI without definitive indications, aligning practice with an individualized, criteria-triggered strategy informed in part by AKIKI and related trials.",

  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "The study compared two RRT initiation strategies: early versus delayed. For this summary, the early-strategy group (RRT started immediately after randomization once KDIGO stage 3 AKI was documented) is treated as the intervention arm, and the delayed-strategy group (RRT initiated only when prespecified urgent criteria or persistent oliguria occurred) is treated as the comparison arm, matching the primary analysis and most clinical interpretations."

  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "The study compared two regimens: apixaban alone vs conventional therapy with enoxaparin followed by warfarin. These are the only two randomized arms, so apixaban was selected as the intervention and enoxaparin plus warfarin as the comparator for all PICO elements and outcomes.",
  "POPULATION": "Adults with acute symptomatic VTE (proximal DVT, PE, or both) requiring at least 6 months of anticoagulation",
  "POPULATION_DETAILS": "Patients ≥18 years with objectively confirmed symptomatic proximal lower-extremity DVT, symptomatic PE, or both, who presented with acute VTE and were considered to require 6 months of anticoagulant treatment. Both provoked and unprovoked events were included, but patients with some transient risk factors (such as perioperative VTE expected to need only short-term therapy) and those with active cancer planned for long-term LMWH were largely excluded.",
  "INTERVENTION": "Apixaban fixed-dose regimen for acute VTE",
  "INTERVENTION_DETAILS": "Oral apixaban given as 10 mg BID for the first 7 days, followed by 5 mg BID for a total treatment duration of 6 months, used as a single-agent regimen without routine parenteral anticoagulation or INR monitoring. A double-dummy design was used so that patients also received placebo injections and tablets matching the comparator regimen.",
  "COMPARISON": "Enoxaparin followed by warfarin (conventional VTE therapy)",
  "COMPARISON_DETAILS": "Subcutaneous enoxaparin 1 mg/kg BID for at least 5 days, overlapped with dose-adjusted warfarin initiated within 72 hours, continued for 6 months with a target INR 2.0–3.0. Enoxaparin was discontinued after at least 5 days and once the INR was in the therapeutic range for at least 24 hours. Matching oral and injectable placebos were used to maintain blinding.",
  "OUTCOME": "Primary efficacy: recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death; Primary safety: major bleeding",
  "OUTCOME_DETAILS": "The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of recurrent symptomatic VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE) or VTE-related death during 6 months of treatment. The principal safety outcomes were major bleeding alone and the composite of major bleeding plus clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Key secondary efficacy outcomes included recurrent symptomatic VTE alone, all-cause mortality, and composite outcomes incorporating bleeding.",

  "CLINICALQUESTION": "In adults with acute symptomatic VTE requiring 6 months of anticoagulation, does a fixed-dose apixaban regimen (10 mg BID for 7 days then 5 mg BID) provide noninferior protection against recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death and reduce major bleeding compared with enoxaparin followed by dose-adjusted warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0)?",
  "CLINICALQUESTION_simple": "In adults with acute symptomatic VTE, does apixaban compared with enoxaparin plus warfarin provide similar protection against recurrent events with better safety outcomes?",
  "BOTTOMLINE": "In adults with acute symptomatic VTE, apixaban given as a fixed-dose single-agent regimen was noninferior to enoxaparin plus warfarin for preventing recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death and substantially reduced major bleeding. These findings support apixaban as an effective and safer alternative to conventional parenteral anticoagulation bridged to warfarin for initial and long-term VTE treatment.",

  ],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this study, standard therapy for acute VTE involved initial parenteral anticoagulation (typically LMWH) bridged to warfarin, which requires frequent INR monitoring and dose adjustments and is associated with variable anticoagulation and bleeding risk. AMPLIFY provided pivotal evidence that a fixed-dose, single-agent oral factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban) could simplify VTE management by avoiding routine injections and laboratory monitoring while maintaining similar efficacy and improving safety, thereby accelerating a shift away from warfarin-based regimens in many patients with VTE.\n\nCurrent VTE guidelines, including contemporary ACCP/CHEST and ESC recommendations, now generally endorse DOACs such as apixaban as preferred first-line therapy over VKAs for most patients with acute VTE who do not have contraindications (e.g., severe renal impairment, mechanical heart valves, significant drug interactions). Subsequent trials and real-world data have confirmed the efficacy and favorable bleeding profile of apixaban, reinforcing the conclusions of AMPLIFY, although guidelines still recommend individualized therapy in special populations such as patients with active cancer, severe renal dysfunction, or very high bleeding risk, where evidence from AMPLIFY is limited.",

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Direct oral factor Xa inhibitors rapidly became preferred agents for many indications because they reduce intracranial hemorrhage and other serious bleeding compared with warfarin, but life-threatening bleeding still occurs and, at the time this study was initiated, no specific reversal agent was available. Clinicians relied on nonspecific therapies such as four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate or supportive care, with uncertain efficacy. ANNEXA-4 provided the first prospective, multicenter data showing that andexanet alfa, a recombinant factor Xa decoy, can substantially reverse anti–factor Xa activity and achieve adjudicated effective hemostasis in real-world patients with severe factor Xa inhibitor–related bleeding, findings that were instrumental in regulatory approval and in shaping early adoption in emergency and critical care practice.\n\nSubsequent full reports and substudies of ANNEXA-4, along with observational comparisons against four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate, have confirmed consistent anti–factor Xa reversal and generally high hemostatic efficacy but also highlighted substantial thrombotic risk and the absence of randomized efficacy data. Contemporary guidance documents such as the 2020 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on Management of Bleeding in Patients on Oral Anticoagulants, the 2022 AHA/ASA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage, the Anticoagulation Forum DOAC reversal guidance, and updated International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis recommendations now generally endorse andexanet alfa as a preferred or reasonable first-line reversal option for life-threatening apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated bleeding when available, with four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate as an alternative. Ongoing evidence, including randomized data comparing andexanet with usual care, continues to refine its role, but ANNEXA-4 remains the foundational study establishing its pharmacologic and hemostatic effects in this setting.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥18 years, use of apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or therapeutic-dose enoxaparin within the prior 18 hours, acute major bleeding (life-threatening hemodynamic compromise, ≥2 g/dL hemoglobin drop or hemoglobin ≤8 g/dL or anticipated to fall ≤8 g/dL, or bleeding in a critical area or organ such as retroperitoneal, intraarticular, pericardial, intracranial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome), for efficacy analyses baseline anti–factor Xa activity ≥75 ng/mL (or ≥0.5 IU/mL for enoxaparin) and adjudicated major bleeding",
  "EXCLUSION": "Planned surgery within 12 hours of presentation (except minimally invasive procedures), intracranial hemorrhage with Glasgow Coma Scale score <7, intracerebral hematoma volume >60 mL, expected survival <1 month, major thrombotic event within 2 weeks before enrollment, receipt within 7 days before screening of a vitamin K antagonist, dabigatran, prothrombin complex concentrate, or whole blood or plasma",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Single-group, open-label design with no randomized control or standard-therapy comparator, limiting causal inference about clinical benefit; Interim analysis with a small sample size (67 patients overall and 47 in the efficacy cohort), reducing precision and power for subgroup analyses; Efficacy population restricted to patients with higher baseline anti–factor Xa activity and strictly adjudicated major bleeding, which may introduce selection bias and limit generalizability to less severe or lower–drug-level bleeds; Coprimary endpoint combined a surrogate laboratory measure (anti–factor Xa activity) with an adjudicated hemostasis scale, and the study could not robustly establish a relationship between degree of laboratory reversal and clinical outcomes; High incidence of thrombotic events despite limited resumption of anticoagulation raises concern about prothrombotic risk and uncertainty about optimal timing for restarting anticoagulation; Heterogeneity in bleeding sites and anticoagulant agents, together with fixed dosing tiers, may not capture all real-world scenarios or allow precise tailoring of dose to bleeding severity; Subsequent observational studies comparing andexanet with four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate have shown mixed results on effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness, reinforcing concerns that this single-arm study cannot define the best reversal strategy.",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "ANNEXA-4 was designed as a single-group cohort in which all 67 enrolled patients received IV andexanet alfa with no placebo or alternative-therapy arm; therefore, INTERVENTION_N reflects the full treated cohort, COMPARISON and COMPARISON_N are null, and all reported primary and secondary outcomes and effect measures are descriptive single-arm results rather than comparative estimates."

  "INTERVENTION": "Antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated appendicitis",
  "INTERVENTION_DETAILS": "Antibiotic group patients received IV ertapenem sodium 1 g once daily for 3 days (first dose in the ED), followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin 500 mg once daily plus metronidazole 500 mg three times daily. Clinical status was reevaluated at 12–24 hours; suspected progressive infection, perforation, or peritonitis prompted appendectomy.",
  "COMPARISON": "Open appendectomy",
  "COMPARISON_DETAILS": "Standard open appendectomy using a McBurney right lower-quadrant muscle-splitting incision; some procedures were laparoscopic at surgeon discretion. Prophylactic antibiotics (cefuroxime 1.5 g plus metronidazole 500 mg IV) were given approximately 30 minutes pre-incision. No further antibiotics were administered postoperatively unless wound infection was suspected.",
  "OUTCOME": "Treatment success at 1 year",
  "OUTCOME_DETAILS": "For the surgical group, the primary endpoint was successful completion of an appendectomy. For the antibiotic group, the primary endpoint was discharge from hospital without the need for surgery and no recurrence of appendicitis during 1-year follow-up.

  "CLINICALQUESTION_simple": "In adults with uncomplicated appendicitis, does initial antibiotic therapy provide comparable short-term success to appendectomy and affect complication rates and recovery?",
  "BOTTOMLINE": "In CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis, initial antibiotic therapy did not meet the prespecified noninferiority margin compared with appendectomy for the primary success endpoint, largely because a substantial minority required appendectomy within 1 year. However, most antibiotic-treated patients avoided surgery during that year and experienced fewer complications and shorter sick leave than those undergoing immediate appendectomy, supporting antibiotics as a reasonable option for selected, well-counseled patients.",
  "BOTTOMLINE_simple": "In adults with uncomplicated appendicitis, initial antibiotic therapy allows most patients to avoid surgery in the first year and results in fewer complications and faster recovery, but a notable proportion ultimately require appendectomy, so both options remain reasonable depending on patient values.",

    "VAS pain at hospital discharge (median score 0–10); 2.0; 3.0; P<0.001"
  ],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "For over a century, emergency appendectomy has been the standard of care for acute appendicitis, based on concerns about progression to perforation and sepsis. Earlier small randomized trials of nonoperative management had methodological limitations, leaving uncertainty about whether antibiotics alone could safely treat uncomplicated appendicitis. The APPAC trial provided high-quality, CT-based evidence showing that most carefully selected adults with uncomplicated appendicitis can be managed initially with antibiotics, with low rates of serious complications even when surgery is delayed, and with clear reductions in postoperative-type morbidity and time off work compared with immediate appendectomy. Although the trial did not statistically demonstrate noninferiority by its strict margin, it shifted practice by framing uncomplicated appendicitis as a condition with more than one reasonable first-line treatment.\nSubsequent studies, including large pragmatic trials such as CODA, and multiple meta-analyses have generally confirmed that antibiotics are a viable alternative to surgery for many patients, at the cost of higher recurrence and later appendectomy rates. Contemporary guidelines, such as the World Society of Emergency Surgery Jerusalem guidelines and professional society statements from surgical organizations, now acknowledge nonoperative antibiotic management as an acceptable option for selected adults with imaging-confirmed uncomplicated appendicitis, particularly without appendicolith, and emphasize shared decision-making. These later data and guidelines refine, rather than overturn, APPAC’s conclusions: appendectomy remains a definitive standard, but antibiotics-first is guideline-endorsed for appropriately selected and well-informed patients.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age 18–60 years, clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis, CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis, appendiceal diameter >6 mm with wall thickening and supportive CT signs (abnormal contrast enhancement, periappendiceal edema or fluid), able to cooperate and provide informed consent",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design with no blinding of patients or clinicians; Primary endpoints defined differently between groups (surgical completion vs 1-year recurrence-free survival), complicating direct comparison; Noninferiority margin of 24% and failure to meet noninferiority despite clinically acceptable outcomes in many antibiotic-treated patients; Use of broad-spectrum IV ertapenem and a 3-day inpatient IV course may limit generalizability and raise stewardship concerns; Restriction to CT-confirmed uncomplicated appendicitis in adults 18–60 years from Finnish hospitals limits applicability to older patients, children, pregnant patients, and settings without routine CT; Predominantly open (not laparoscopic) appendectomy may not reflect outcomes in centers where laparoscopy is standard; Only 1-year outcomes in the original trial, with longer-term recurrence characterized later, so initial interpretation of durability of antibiotic therapy was limited."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin were long the standard for stroke prevention in AF, but their use is limited by food and drug interactions, the need for frequent INR monitoring, and bleeding risk. ARISTOTLE provided pivotal evidence that a factor Xa inhibitor, apixaban, could not only match but surpass well-managed warfarin in efficacy and safety, showing superiority for preventing stroke or systemic embolism, less major bleeding, and lower mortality in a broad nonvalvular AF population. Along with other large DOAC trials, ARISTOTLE helped shift practice away from routine warfarin use toward DOACs for eligible patients.\n\nCurrent AF guidelines from major societies, including recent ACC/AHA/HRS and ESC AF guidelines, recommend DOACs over warfarin for most patients with nonvalvular AF who require anticoagulation, and they frequently highlight apixaban as a first-line option based substantially on ARISTOTLE and subsequent confirmatory real-world data. Newer studies and postmarketing experience have generally reinforced ARISTOTLE’s findings, supporting apixaban’s favorable balance of stroke prevention and bleeding risk; guideline recommendations remain consistent with the trial’s conclusions, while noting that results do not apply to patients with mechanical valves, moderate–severe mitral stenosis, or severe renal impairment, who still require other anticoagulation strategies.",

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before ASCEND, pirfenidone had shown mixed results across prior phase 3 trials, with one Japanese study and one CAPACITY study positive for FVC preservation and the other CAPACITY study negative, leaving uncertainty about its true efficacy in IPF. ASCEND, with centralized diagnostic adjudication and a higher-risk mild-to-moderate IPF cohort, confirmed that pirfenidone meaningfully attenuates FVC decline, improves exercise-capacity–based and progression-free survival endpoints, and supports its use as an antifibrotic backbone therapy in IPF, contributing to regulatory approval and routine clinical adoption.\nThe 2015 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT treatment guideline for IPF gave conditional recommendations for use of pirfenidone and nintedanib as standard antifibrotic options, a position maintained and refined in the 2022 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guideline on IPF and progressive pulmonary fibrosis, which continues to endorse antifibrotic therapy to slow disease progression rather than reverse established fibrosis. Subsequent long-term extension and post hoc analyses have broadly confirmed sustained benefit and acceptable safety of pirfenidone, without evidence that would overturn ASCEND’s conclusions, though newer data emphasize ongoing disease progression and the need for additional or combination therapies.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age 40–80 years, centrally confirmed IPF with definite or possible UIP pattern on HRCT (possible UIP confirmed by surgical lung biopsy), FVC 50–90% predicted, DLCO 30–90% predicted, FEV1/FVC ≥0.80, 6-minute walk distance ≥150 m",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Primary endpoint was short-term change in FVC over 52 weeks rather than longer-term clinical outcomes such as mortality or hospitalization; Study population was limited to mild-to-moderate IPF (FVC 50–90%, DLCO 30–90%), reducing generalizability to patients with very advanced disease or significant comorbid lung disease; One-year follow-up may underestimate long-term benefits, risks, and durability of treatment effect; The trial was sponsored and funded by the drug manufacturer, introducing potential bias despite standard measures for trial oversight and data integrity; Mortality findings in ASCEND alone were underpowered and nonsignificant, and stronger mortality inferences relied on prespecified pooled analysis with prior CAPACITY trials rather than ASCEND by itself."

  ],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Patients with AF who experience ACS or undergo PCI have traditionally been treated with triple therapy (oral anticoagulant plus DAPT), which reduces ischemic risk but markedly increases bleeding. Earlier, smaller trials suggested that dual therapy with an oral anticoagulant and a single P2Y12 inhibitor might offer a better safety profile, but data with apixaban and robust comparative evidence against VKAs and aspirin were lacking; AUGUSTUS, the largest trial in this space, demonstrated that apixaban and omission of aspirin can substantially reduce bleeding and hospitalizations while preserving ischemic protection, helping to shift practice toward NOAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor regimens.\n\nSubsequent analyses and meta-analyses have confirmed that in AF patients after ACS/PCI, NOAC-based dual therapy, particularly apixaban plus a P2Y12 inhibitor without routine long-term aspirin, minimizes bleeding without a clear loss of efficacy. Contemporary guidelines, including the 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS AF guideline and recent ESC ACS guidelines, now recommend NOACs over VKAs and favor dual therapy (NOAC plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, usually clopidogrel) with only a short initial period of triple therapy when necessary; these recommendations explicitly incorporate AUGUSTUS alongside other AF-PCI trials, and no major guideline currently recommends routine prolonged VKA-based triple therapy for most such patients.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥18 years, established AF with indication for long-term oral anticoagulation, recent ACS or PCI with planned P2Y12 inhibitor therapy for at least 6 months, randomization within 14 days of index ACS or PCI",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design for the anticoagulant comparison may introduce bias in management and event reporting, particularly for bleeding; Follow-up limited to 6 months with relatively low absolute rates of ischemic events, so the trial was not powered to detect modest differences in ischemic outcomes such as stent thrombosis; Time in therapeutic range for the VKA arm was modest (around 59%), potentially underrepresenting the benefits of optimally managed warfarin; Majority of patients were white and most received clopidogrel rather than more potent P2Y12 inhibitors, which may limit generalizability to more diverse populations and different antiplatelet strategies; Patients with severe renal dysfunction, mechanical valves, and some very high-risk groups were excluded, so results may not apply to these populations; Factorial design focused on main effects of apixaban vs VKA and aspirin vs placebo, meaning the study was not specifically powered for definitive conclusions about all four individual regimen combinations for rare efficacy endpoints.",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "AUGUSTUS used a 2×2 factorial design randomizing patients to apixaban vs VKA and to aspirin vs placebo, creating four regimens. For this summary, the primary comparison is defined as apixaban-based versus VKA-based anticoagulation (each combined with a P2Y12 inhibitor and with aspirin or placebo per the factorial design) because this reflects the main effect emphasized in the primary analysis and best captures the core clinical question of NOAC vs VKA in AF patients after ACS/PCI. The aspirin vs placebo factor and specific four-way regimen comparisons, while clinically important, are not used as the primary PICO contrast here."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before CANVAS, empagliflozin had shown cardiovascular benefit in T2DM with established ASCVD, but it was unclear whether this was a class effect and how robust the kidney benefits would be. The CANVAS Program, by integrating two large outcomes trials in over 10,000 high-risk patients, demonstrated that canagliflozin reduced 3-point MACE, slowed progression of albuminuria, and improved a composite kidney outcome, thus reinforcing SGLT2 inhibitors as cardiorenal drugs rather than purely glucose-lowering agents and extending cardiovascular protection to a broader high-risk T2DM population. At the same time, the unexpected signal for increased lower-limb amputations and concerns about fracture risk complicated early adoption and prompted regulatory warnings and intensive post-trial scrutiny.\n\nSubsequent trials, especially those focused on kidney disease and heart failure, along with meta-analyses, have generally confirmed the cardiorenal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors and supported their use as foundational therapy in T2DM with ASCVD, HF, or CKD. Current ADA Standards of Care, KDIGO 2022 Diabetes in CKD guidance, and the 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA heart failure guideline all endorse SGLT2 inhibitors (including canagliflozin) for reducing MACE, HF hospitalization, and CKD progression in appropriate patients, often regardless of background metformin use or baseline HbA1c, while recommending caution or alternative agents in patients with active foot ulceration, prior major amputation, or other high limb-risk features given the CANVAS amputation signal.",
  "INCLUSION": "Adults with T2DM, HbA1c 7.0–10.5%, Age ≥30 y with symptomatic atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or age ≥50 y with at least two cardiovascular risk factors (long diabetes duration, elevated SBP on antihypertensive therapy, current smoker, albuminuria, low HDL), eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2, High cardiovascular risk (established ASCVD or multiple risk factors)",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Participants had longstanding T2DM with established ASCVD or multiple cardiovascular risk factors and eGFR ≥30, so results may not generalize to lower-risk patients, those with early diabetes, or those with more advanced kidney disease; The CANVAS Program pooled two related trials (CANVAS and CANVAS-R) with some differences in design and follow-up, and notable heterogeneity in certain outcomes such as fracture risk between the component trials remains unexplained; Renal endpoints, although numerically favorable, did not formally meet statistical significance under the prespecified hierarchical testing sequence in the primary NEJM report, so kidney benefits in CANVAS are considered supportive rather than definitive; The increased risks of lower-limb amputation and fractures observed in CANVAS have unclear mechanisms and no clearly defined high-risk subgroup, and subsequent trials of canagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors have not consistently replicated these safety signals, raising the possibility of chance findings but leaving residual uncertainty; Some secondary and safety outcomes had relatively low event counts, which limited power to detect modest differences and led to wide confidence intervals, particularly for individual renal endpoints, fracture subtypes, and amputation subgroups."

CAP-START provided randomized evidence that, in a setting with low prevalence of atypical pathogens and low pneumococcal resistance, a strategy of beta-lactam monotherapy is noninferior to combination beta-lactam–macrolide therapy and fluoroquinolone monotherapy for 90-day mortality, supporting more conservative empiric regimens in similar epidemiologic contexts.\nIn current practice, the ATS/IDSA 2007 and updated 2019 CAP guidelines continue to recommend either a beta-lactam plus macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone as first-line therapy for most hospitalized non-ICU CAP patients, particularly in regions with higher rates of atypical pathogens and resistance. CAP-START is cited as evidence that beta-lactam monotherapy may be reasonable in lower-severity, non-ICU patients in areas with low atypical prevalence and favorable resistance patterns, but U.S. guidelines have not broadly shifted to beta-lactam monotherapy as the default strategy and instead emphasize local epidemiology and stewardship-informed tailoring of empiric therapy.",

CARAVAGGIO tested whether the oral factor Xa inhibitor apixaban could provide noninferior protection from recurrent VTE compared with dalteparin without excess major bleeding, and its finding of similar efficacy and bleeding risk, including in patients with GI malignancy, broadened acceptance of DOACs in this setting.\n\nSubsequent guideline updates from oncology and hematology societies, including ASCO VTE guidelines (2020 and 2023 updates) and ASH guidance on VTE management in patients with cancer, incorporated apixaban alongside edoxaban and rivaroxaban as a recommended option for initial and short-term treatment of cancer-associated DVT/PE, while still favoring LMWH in selected high-bleeding-risk situations.

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Organized CRC screening programs historically relied on guaiac-based FOBT or colonoscopy, with observational data suggesting greater incidence and mortality reductions with colonoscopy but at the cost of invasiveness, procedure risk, and capacity constraints. COLONPREV provided the first large, head-to-head randomized comparison of a colonoscopy-based vs programmatic FIT-based strategy in an average-risk population, showing higher participation with FIT and, on long-term follow-up, non-inferior CRC mortality compared with colonoscopy. These findings helped shift emphasis from test sensitivity alone toward overall program effectiveness driven by both test performance and real-world adherence.\nCurrent guidelines such as the USPSTF CRC screening recommendation, American Cancer Society guidelines, and European colorectal screening guidance endorse multiple first-line options, including colonoscopy at 10-y intervals and high-sensitivity stool tests such as annual or biennial FIT. The full COLONPREV results, along with complementary trials, support guideline positions that FIT-based programs can achieve CRC mortality reductions comparable to colonoscopy when participation is high and follow-up colonoscopy for positive FIT is ensured, reinforcing a shared decision-making approach that prioritizes patient preference, adherence, and local endoscopic capacity rather than colonoscopy-only strategies.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age 50–69 y, average-risk for CRC, asymptomatic, no prior organized CRC screening in the program, able to undergo colonoscopy if indicated",
  "EXCLUSION": "Personal history of CRC, prior colorectal adenoma, inflammatory bowel disease, family history of hereditary or familial CRC (≥2 first-degree relatives with CRC or 1 diagnosed before age 60 y), severe comorbidities precluding screening, previous colectomy",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "The original 2012 NEJM report was an interim analysis and did not report the primary endpoint of 10-y CRC mortality, limiting early conclusions about long-term effectiveness; Overall participation rates in both arms were modest, which may attenuate the population-level impact of either strategy and raises concerns about generalizability to settings with different screening cultures; The trial compared invitation strategies rather than mandatory testing, so results reflect effectiveness of an invitation-based program and not pure test efficacy; The FIT strategy requires sustained biennial participation over time, whereas early publications mainly described baseline round outcomes, leaving uncertainty about long-term adherence and program performance until later reports; Conducted entirely within the Spanish healthcare system with specific FIT brand and cutoff thresholds, so implementation details and performance may not fully generalize to other countries, healthcare systems, or FIT assays; Nonadherence and crossover (off-protocol opportunistic screening) could dilute differences between strategies and bias intention-to-screen estimates toward equivalence.",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "COLONPREV randomized participants 1:1 to two main programmatic strategies: invitation to a single screening colonoscopy vs invitation to biennial FIT with colonoscopy for positives. These two invitation-based strategies constitute the core comparison throughout the trial and are the basis for the prespecified primary endpoint of 10-y CRC mortality; therefore, for PICO, results, and clinical questions, the selected intervention arm is the colonoscopy invitation arm and the selected comparator is the biennial FIT invitation arm, without combining or subdividing arms beyond how they were defined in the original protocol."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before CREDENCE, renin–angiotensin system blockade with ACEi or ARB was essentially the only established disease-modifying therapy for diabetic kidney disease, and prior SGLT2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcome trials had suggested renal benefit but were not designed or powered for hard kidney outcomes in a high-risk CKD population. CREDENCE was the first dedicated kidney outcome trial of an SGLT2 inhibitor in T2DM with albuminuric CKD, demonstrating substantial reductions in kidney failure and cardiorenal events on top of optimized ACEi/ARB therapy and helping to shift SGLT2 inhibitors from glucose-lowering agents to core nephroprotective and cardioprotective drugs.\n\nSubsequent guidelines, including KDIGO 2020 and 2022 diabetes-in-CKD guidance and recent ADA Standards of Care, now recommend SGLT2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin for patients with T2DM and CKD (particularly with albuminuria and eGFR above the drug-specific threshold) to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events. Later trials like DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY, which extended evidence to non-diabetic CKD and lower eGFR ranges, have largely confirmed and broadened the class effect suggested by CREDENCE, so current recommendations emphasize SGLT2 inhibitors as foundational therapy alongside RAAS blockade, rather than as purely glycemic agents.",

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this trial, early revascularization for MI-related cardiogenic shock was known to improve outcomes, but most such patients have multivessel CAD and practice guidelines had favored immediate multivessel PCI based largely on observational data and extrapolation from non-shock STEMI trials. CULPRIT-SHOCK directly tested culprit-lesion-only PCI versus immediate multivessel PCI in this high-risk population and showed that limiting initial PCI to the culprit lesion reduced the composite of death or severe renal failure, largely through lower early mortality, challenging the previous paradigm that more complete acute revascularization is always better in shock.\n\nSubsequent guideline updates have incorporated these findings: contemporary ESC guidelines for ACS and myocardial revascularization recommend that in cardiogenic shock the immediate PCI strategy be restricted to the culprit lesion, with nonculprit lesions treated in staged procedures once the patient stabilizes, and the 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI coronary revascularization guidelines classify routine noninfarct-artery PCI at the time of primary PCI in cardiogenic shock as harmful, while supporting staged multivessel revascularization in stable patients. Longer-term follow-up from CULPRIT-SHOCK and other observational data have generally confirmed the early benefit of a culprit-only strategy, with some attenuation of mortality differences over time but continued endorsement of culprit-lesion-only PCI with selective, staged treatment of residual disease.",

Before this trial, recommendations to maintain hematocrit below 45% were based largely on pathophysiologic reasoning and observational data, with prior prospective studies suggesting no clear difference in thrombosis risk across a range of hematocrit values below about 50%. The CYTO-PV trial provided the first randomized evidence that more intensive hematocrit control (<45%) meaningfully reduces cardiovascular death and major thrombosis compared with a less-intensive target (45–50%), thus solidifying a specific hematocrit goal for clinical practice.\n\nSubsequent guidelines from major organizations, including European LeukemiaNet, the British Society for Haematology, and North American groups such as NCCN and other expert panels, have incorporated the CYTO-PV findings by endorsing a hematocrit target <45% for most patients with PV, particularly those at high thrombotic risk. Later observational studies and real-world data have generally confirmed that tighter hematocrit control is associated with fewer thrombotic events, without strong evidence contradicting the trial’s main conclusion. Current guidelines continue to recommend maintaining hematocrit <45% using phlebotomy and cytoreductive therapy (most commonly hydroxyurea), often in combination with low-dose aspirin, and they explicitly cite this hematocrit threshold as a central treatment objective in PV.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Trial was stopped early after enrolling 365 of a planned 1,000 patients, reducing statistical power and precision of effect estimates; Open-label design with knowledge of hematocrit targets could have influenced management decisions or reporting, despite blinded endpoint adjudication; Imbalances between groups included higher leukocyte counts and lower hydroxyurea use in the high-hematocrit arm, which may have confounded thrombotic risk; Only about three-quarters of patients were consistently maintained within their assigned hematocrit target range, potentially diluting the observed treatment effect; Conducted exclusively in Italian centers with patients already receiving phlebotomy and/or hydroxyurea, which may limit generalizability to other health systems or to treatment-naive populations"

  "BOTTOMLINE": "Among event-free, adherent patients after DES PCI, continuing thienopyridine plus aspirin from 12 to 30 months reduced stent thrombosis and MACCE compared with switching to aspirin alone but increased moderate/severe bleeding and was associated with a signal for higher noncardiovascular mortality. Prolonged DAPT should therefore be individualized, favoring patients with high ischemic and low bleeding risk rather than applied routinely to all DES recipients.",
  "BOTTOMLINE_simple": "In stable post-DES patients, prolonged DAPT beyond 12 months lowers ischemic events but increases bleeding and has uncertain effects on mortality.",

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Concerns about late and very late stent thrombosis with first-generation DES led to guideline recommendations for at least 12 months of DAPT after DES implantation, but the optimal duration beyond 1 year was uncertain and small prior trials were underpowered for stent-related outcomes. The DAPT trial provided the first large, adequately powered randomized evidence showing that extending DAPT from 12 to 30 months after DES PCI lowers stent thrombosis and recurrent MI at the cost of more major bleeding and a signal toward higher noncardiovascular mortality, shaping thinking about duration of therapy and leading to the development of the DAPT score for risk–benefit stratification.\n\nSubsequent trials and meta-analyses have shown that shorter DAPT (3–6 months or even 1 month in high-bleeding-risk patients) is safe for many contemporary DES recipients, while extended DAPT can be beneficial in selected high-ischemic-risk, low-bleeding-risk patients. Current ACC/AHA and ESC chronic coronary syndrome and ACS guidelines generally recommend 6–12 months of DAPT after DES, with options for shorter courses in high bleeding risk and extended therapy beyond 12 months in patients with high ischemic risk (often guided by tools like the DAPT score); these guidelines cite DAPT as key evidence supporting selective, not routine, prolongation of therapy.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age >18, PCI with an approved DES, suitable for at least 30 months of DAPT, completed 12 months of aspirin + thienopyridine after DES, free of death, MI, stroke, repeat coronary revascularization, stent thrombosis, or major (moderate/severe) bleeding during the first 12 months, adherent to DAPT at 12 months",
  "EXCLUSION": "Stent diameter <2.25 mm or >4.0 mm at index procedure, need for warfarin or similar long-term anticoagulation, planned surgery requiring interruption of antiplatelet therapy within the study treatment period, life expectancy <3 years, pregnancy, hypersensitivity or allergy to study drugs or stent components, treatment with both DES and BMS during the index procedure, major ischemic or bleeding events before 12 months, PCI or cardiac surgery between 6 weeks and 12 months after index procedure, switch in thienopyridine type or dose within 6 months prior to randomization",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Randomized population included only patients who were event-free and fully compliant with DAPT during the first year after DES implantation, limiting generalizability to higher-risk or nonadherent patients; Exclusion of patients with major bleeding or ischemic events before 12 months may underestimate bleeding risk and overestimate net benefit of prolonged DAPT in routine practice; A substantial proportion of patients received first-generation paclitaxel-eluting stents, so results may not fully reflect outcomes with newer-generation DES; The observed increase in noncardiovascular and cancer-related mortality with prolonged DAPT remains unexplained and may represent either a chance finding or unrecognized biologic harm; The trial was funded by multiple stent and drug manufacturers, raising potential concerns about sponsorship bias despite randomized, blinded design and independent adjudication; Primary publication focused on DES-treated patients, while BMS results were reported separately and were underpowered, complicating extrapolation of treatment effects across all stent types."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before DAWN, multiple randomized trials had established mechanical thrombectomy as standard of care for anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion stroke when performed within 6 hours of onset, but patients presenting later or with wake-up strokes lacked proven therapy. DAWN tested the hypothesis that patients with a small infarct core but disproportionately severe clinical deficit, identified with automated DWI or CT perfusion imaging, could still benefit from endovascular reperfusion up to 24 hours after last known well, demonstrating a large improvement in functional outcomes and shifting the field from purely time-based to tissue- and physiology-based selection.\n\nThese results, together with the companion DEFUSE 3 trial, were rapidly incorporated into major guidelines such as the 2018 and subsequent American Heart Association/American Stroke Association acute ischemic stroke guidelines and European Stroke Organisation guidance, which recommend mechanical thrombectomy for eligible anterior circulation large-vessel occlusions 6–16 hours after onset and consider it reasonable 16–24 hours after onset when DAWN or DEFUSE 3 imaging criteria are met. More recent observational cohorts and an individual patient data meta-analysis of late-window thrombectomy have confirmed substantial functional benefit with acceptable safety, while exploratory studies of thrombectomy beyond 24 hours remain investigational, so current guidelines still restrict routine late-window thrombectomy to patients closely matching the DAWN/DEFUSE 3 profiles.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥18 years, last known well to randomization 6–24 hours, prestroke mRS 0–1, acute ischemic stroke due to intracranial internal carotid artery and/or M1 MCA occlusion on CTA or MRA, NIHSS ≥10, no intracranial hemorrhage on CT or MRI, infarct involving <1/3 MCA territory on baseline imaging, small infarct core with clinical-core mismatch per DAWN age/NIHSS/core volume criteria (core <21 mL if age ≥80 years; core <31 mL if age <80 years with NIHSS ≥10; core 31 to <51 mL if age <80 years with NIHSS ≥20)",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label treatment assignment introduces potential performance bias despite blinded outcome assessment; Early termination at a prespecified interim analysis for efficacy may exaggerate the magnitude of the observed treatment effect; Highly selected population with small infarct cores, good prestroke function, anterior circulation large-vessel occlusions, and access to advanced perfusion or DWI imaging with automated RAPID software limits generalizability to broader stroke populations and resource-limited centers; Exclusive use of a single stent retriever (Trevo) and prohibition of rescue devices or intra-arterial drugs restrict applicability to other thrombectomy technologies and real-world practice patterns; Bayesian adaptive-enrichment design and modest overall sample size mean that precision for subgroup and safety estimates is limited; Industry sponsorship by the device manufacturer raises concern for potential subtle biases, even though the trial design and blinded outcome assessment were robust."

For PICO and outcome extraction, the FMT regimen was selected as the intervention and standard 14-day vancomycin alone as the comparator, because vancomycin monotherapy represents the most conventional antibiotic standard of care and is the most clinically relevant benchmark.",

  "SECONDARYOUTCOMES": [],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this trial, recurrent CDI was typically managed with repeated or prolonged courses of vancomycin or metronidazole, often with high failure and relapse rates, and FMT had only observational support. This randomized study was the first to show that FMT delivered via duodenal infusion after short-course vancomycin and bowel lavage was dramatically more effective than standard vancomycin regimens, catalyzing wider acceptance of microbiota-based therapy for multiply recurrent CDI and shifting practice away from reliance on extended antibiotic courses alone.\nSubsequent evidence and guidelines, including IDSA/SHEA 2021 and ACG 2021 CDI guidelines, endorse FMT as an option for patients with multiple CDI recurrences who have failed appropriate antibiotic regimens, generally after at least two recurrences, while emphasizing stringent donor and stool screening in light of FDA safety alerts. More recent guidance from gastroenterology societies supports FMT or standardized microbiota-based therapeutics for most patients with recurrent CDI, confirming the trial’s core conclusion that microbiota restoration is superior to antibiotics alone, although newer agents (such as fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab) and safety considerations have refined how and when FMT is used.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age >18 years, relapse of CDI after at least one prior adequate antibiotic course, diarrhea with ≥3 loose or watery stools per day for ≥2 consecutive days or ≥8 loose stools in 48 hours, positive stool test for C. difficile toxin, hemodynamically stable and not critically ill",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design without blinding of patients or treating clinicians, introducing potential performance and ascertainment bias; Small single-center sample size with early termination after interim analysis, resulting in wide confidence intervals and risk of overestimating treatment effect; Control antibiotic regimen did not include tapered or pulsed vancomycin or fidaxomicin, limiting comparison with some contemporary standard-of-care strategies for recurrent CDI; Exclusion of critically ill patients, those with severe immunodeficiency, and those requiring concurrent systemic antibiotics reduces generalizability to higher-risk CDI populations; Requirement for fresh donor stool, extensive donor screening, bowel lavage, and nasoduodenal tube placement may limit feasibility and does not define the optimal FMT protocol (route, preparation, number of infusions); Long-term safety, including risks of transmitting pathogens or altering host metabolic and immune profiles, was not systematically evaluated in this trial."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this trial, the optimal timing of surgery for left-sided native valve infective endocarditis with large vegetations was uncertain, with concern that operating too early might increase perioperative risk and prosthetic valve infection, while delaying surgery risked devastating embolic events. EASE provided randomized evidence that in carefully selected patients without overt heart failure or uncontrolled infection, an early surgical strategy focused on prompt removal of large vegetations and correction of severe valve dysfunction substantially reduces embolic events and improves short-term composite outcomes compared with conventional treatment, shifting practice toward earlier consideration of surgery in this subgroup.\nCurrent guidelines such as the ESC infective endocarditis guidelines and the AHA/ACC infective endocarditis recommendations explicitly incorporate early surgery for patients with left-sided IE and large vegetations at high embolic risk, often citing this trial as supporting evidence, while emphasizing the need for individualized multidisciplinary decision-making. Subsequent observational studies and long-term follow-up of the EASE cohort have generally confirmed that early surgery reduces embolic complications and improves event-free survival without clearly changing long-term all-cause mortality, and contemporary guidelines now endorse early surgery in similar patients, though the small, highly selected study population limits the generalizability of its mortality findings.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age 15–80 years, definite left-sided infective endocarditis by modified Duke criteria, involvement of native mitral and/or aortic valve, severe valve disease (typically severe regurgitation), large left-sided vegetations associated with high embolic risk, hemodynamically stable without urgent indication for surgery, suitable candidate for cardiac surgery",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Small single-country sample with only 76 patients limits statistical power and precision of effect estimates; Highly selected population excluding patients with heart failure, abscess, prosthetic valves, right-sided disease, or major stroke reduces generalizability to typical infective endocarditis cohorts; Open-label design without blinding introduces potential bias in clinical decision-making and outcome assessment, particularly for embolic endpoints; High crossover to surgery in the conventional group (most patients ultimately operated) means the study primarily tests timing of surgery rather than surgery versus medical therapy alone; Short 6-month follow-up in the main report limits assessment of long-term mortality, prosthetic valve complications, and recurrent infective endocarditis; Conducted at experienced centers with strong surgical and endocarditis teams, so benefits of early surgery may not be reproducible in lower-volume or less specialized settings; Editorials and reviews have noted that the strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and small size make it difficult to extrapolate these results to patients with more advanced heart failure, complex valve destruction, or multiple comorbidities."

  "BOTTOMLINE": "Among patients with prior VTE who had completed 6–12 months of anticoagulation and were in equipoise about continuing therapy, extended rivaroxaban 10 mg daily substantially reduced recurrent VTE or unexplained death compared with aspirin 100 mg daily, without increasing major bleeding. These results support using reduced-dose rivaroxaban rather than aspirin for extended secondary prevention in appropriate VTE patients.",

  ],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Recurrent VTE risk remains substantial after an initial 3–12 month course of anticoagulation, especially in patients with unprovoked events or persistent risk factors, but long-term full-dose anticoagulation raises bleeding concerns. Before this study, some clinicians opted to stop anticoagulation or to switch to aspirin for extended prevention based on smaller aspirin trials, despite relatively modest protection. EINSTEIN CHOICE directly compared full-dose and reduced-dose rivaroxaban with aspirin after 6–12 months of prior anticoagulation and showed that both rivaroxaban doses, including the 10 mg regimen, markedly reduced recurrent VTE with no significant increase in major bleeding compared with aspirin, helping to establish reduced-dose DOACs as a strategy for extended VTE therapy.\n\nSubsequent VTE treatment guidelines, including major statements from the American Society of Hematology (2020) and the American College of Chest Physicians (2021), now recommend anticoagulation rather than aspirin for patients who require extended secondary prevention and endorse reduced-dose DOAC regimens such as rivaroxaban 10 mg daily as acceptable options after completion of primary treatment. These guidelines explicitly highlight that trials like EINSTEIN CHOICE were not powered to definitively compare reduced-dose with full-dose regimens and excluded patients with the highest recurrence risk, so current recommendations emphasize individualized assessment of recurrence and bleeding risks, and note ongoing uncertainty about benefits and risks of therapy beyond the 1–4 years studied.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥18 years, symptomatic proximal DVT or PE objectively confirmed, completed 6–12 months of therapeutic anticoagulation for index VTE, no interruption of anticoagulation >7 days before randomization, clinician equipoise regarding need for extended anticoagulation",
  "EXCLUSION": "Contraindication to continuation of anticoagulation, requirement for extended full-dose anticoagulation at therapeutic intensity, need for concurrent antiplatelet therapy, creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Follow-up was limited to about 1 year, so durability of benefit and long-term bleeding risk beyond this period remain uncertain; Patients who clearly required ongoing therapeutic-dose anticoagulation (such as those with very high recurrence risk) were excluded, limiting generalizability to these higher-risk groups; The trial was not powered to establish noninferiority of rivaroxaban 10 mg versus 20 mg, so the relative efficacy and safety of reduced-dose compared with full-dose rivaroxaban remain uncertain; The proportion of patients with active cancer or severe renal impairment was low, so applicability of these findings to those populations is limited.",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "EINSTEIN CHOICE randomized patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily, or aspirin 100 mg once daily. For this summary, rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily was chosen as the intervention arm and aspirin 100 mg once daily as the comparator because the trial was designed to test both rivaroxaban doses against aspirin, and subsequent guidelines and clinical practice most commonly use the reduced 10 mg rivaroxaban dose for extended VTE prevention. All reported outcomes and sample sizes here refer only to the rivaroxaban 10 mg and aspirin arms."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before EMPA-REG OUTCOME, multiple large trials of intensive glycemic control and other glucose-lowering agents in T2DM had largely failed to show clear reductions in hard CV outcomes, and some drug classes raised concerns about HF risk. EMPA-REG OUTCOME was one of the first dedicated cardiovascular outcome trials of a glucose-lowering agent to demonstrate robust reductions in CV mortality, HF hospitalization, and all-cause mortality on top of contemporary standard care, suggesting drug-specific cardioprotective effects beyond modest improvements in HbA1c, weight, and BP and reshaping expectations for diabetes therapies.\n\nSubsequent outcome trials with other SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists have broadly confirmed cardiovascular and renal benefits, and current major guidelines (such as the ADA 2024 Standards of Care, KDIGO 2022 Diabetes in CKD guideline, and ACC/AHA and ESC cardiovascular and HF guidelines) now recommend SGLT2 inhibitors like empagliflozin in patients with T2DM and established ASCVD, HF, or CKD to reduce CV events and slow kidney disease. More recent HF trials have extended SGLT2 inhibitor use to patients without diabetes, so EMPA-REG OUTCOME is now viewed as a foundational trial that initiated, rather than alone defined, the modern paradigm of cardiorenal protection with SGLT2 inhibition.",
  "INCLUSION": "T2DM, age ≥18 years (≥20 years in Japan; ≤65 years in India), established atherosclerotic CVD (prior MI, multivessel CAD, single-vessel CAD with ischemia or recent unstable angina, prior ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, or symptomatic PAD), HbA1c 7–10% on stable glucose-lowering therapy or 7–9% drug-naïve, BMI ≤45 kg/m2, eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2, stable background CV risk-factor therapy per local standards",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Trial population consisted almost entirely of T2DM patients with established atherosclerotic CVD, so generalizability to lower-risk or primary-prevention patients without documented CVD is limited; Median observation of about 3.1 years leaves some uncertainty about the very long-term durability and safety of empagliflozin’s cardiovascular and renal benefits; The magnitude and early onset of reductions in CV and all-cause mortality are not fully explained by the modest differences in HbA1c, weight, BP, and lipids, and the precise mechanisms of benefit remain unclear; As a manufacturer-sponsored trial with a hierarchical testing strategy focused on CV outcomes and pooled empagliflozin doses, questions remain about comparative effectiveness versus other glucose-lowering agents and across the SGLT2 inhibitor class; Increased genital infections were observed with empagliflozin, and the study was not powered to reliably detect very rare but serious adverse events such as diabetic ketoacidosis, fractures, or amputations; Because nearly all participants had pre-existing CVD and were predominantly older and male, data are relatively sparse for younger patients, women, and those with earlier-stage diabetes or different ethnic backgrounds."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "HFpEF has long been associated with high morbidity and frequent HF hospitalizations, yet prior large trials of RAAS antagonists, MRAs, and ARNIs showed at best modest or equivocal benefits, particularly for hard outcomes. EMPEROR-Preserved was the first large RCT in patients with HF and LVEF >40% to demonstrate a significant reduction in a clinically meaningful composite of CV death or HF hospitalization using an SGLT2 inhibitor, with a clear and consistent reduction in HF hospitalizations across subgroups and only a modest effect on mortality. This trial, together with prior evidence in HFrEF, shifted the paradigm by extending the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition across the HF spectrum.\n\nSubsequent data, including the DELIVER trial with dapagliflozin and multiple pooled analyses, have confirmed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HF events across HFpEF and HFmrEF, primarily by lowering HF hospitalizations without a large mortality effect. Current major guidelines, including the 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA HF Guideline and the 2023 focused update of the ESC HF Guidelines, now recommend SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin or dapagliflozin) for patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved EF, regardless of diabetes status, as foundational therapy alongside diuretics and comorbidity management. These guidelines view EMPEROR-Preserved as a key underpinning trial, and later evidence has largely reinforced its conclusions while highlighting slightly attenuated benefit at very high EF (≥60%).",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Primary benefit was driven by reduction in HF hospitalizations with no significant reduction in CV or all-cause mortality, limiting impact on survival; Absolute risk reduction in the primary composite outcome was modest, so many patients must be treated to prevent a single event; Inclusion of patients with LVEF 40–49% means results apply to a mixed HFpEF/HFmrEF population, and benefit appeared attenuated in those with EF ≥60%; Strict entry criteria (elevated NT-proBNP and prior HF hospitalization or structural heart disease) may limit generalizability to lower-risk HFpEF patients; Patients with severe renal dysfunction (eGFR <20 mL/min/1.73 m2), recent acute coronary events, or acute decompensated HF were excluded, so safety and efficacy in these groups remain uncertain; Discontinuation rates were relatively high and quality-of-life gains, while statistically significant, were small in magnitude; Increased rates of genital and urinary tract infections and hypotension highlight the need for careful monitoring, particularly in frail or volume-depleted patients."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Convulsive status epilepticus is the most common life-threatening neurological emergency in childhood, and for decades phenytoin was recommended as the standard second-line IV anticonvulsant after benzodiazepines despite limited trial data and well-recognized risks of hypotension and arrhythmias. EcLiPSE, together with the contemporaneous ConSEPT paediatric trial, provided the first adequately powered randomized comparison of levetiracetam versus phenytoin in children, showing no clear superiority of levetiracetam but similar seizure cessation rates and very few serious adverse reactions, which helped shift practice away from a phenytoin-only paradigm toward offering levetiracetam as a reasonable alternative.\n\nSubsequent guidelines and policies, including the 2022 epilepsy guideline from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the American Epilepsy Society convulsive status epilepticus guideline, and the American College of Emergency Physicians 2014 seizure policy, now list IV levetiracetam alongside phenytoin/fosphenytoin and valproate as acceptable second-line options after benzodiazepines, often highlighting levetiracetam’s easier administration and safety profile. Later trials across age groups, such as the Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial, and paediatric meta-analyses have confirmed broadly similar efficacy between these agents, so current algorithms generally individualize second-line choice based on comorbidities, drug interactions, and logistics, with EcLiPSE remaining a key paediatric data set underpinning the acceptance of levetiracetam as an alternative to phenytoin.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age 6 months to <18 years, generalised tonic–clonic, generalised clonic, or focal clonic convulsive status epilepticus, required second-line IV anticonvulsant after guideline-based first-line treatment (typically benzodiazepines or personalized rescue plan)",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label, unblinded design with seizure cessation and timing determined by treating clinicians rather than blinded assessors, introducing potential observer bias in the primary outcome; Primary endpoint of time from randomisation to visible seizure cessation includes pre-infusion delays and infusion duration, so it partly reflects logistical factors rather than pure pharmacologic effect; Trial did not reach the originally planned sample size and was not powered to detect modest differences in rare safety outcomes or mortality; Superiority design and wide confidence intervals mean the study cannot establish non-inferiority or true equivalence between levetiracetam and phenytoin despite similar point estimates; Reliance on clinical rather than electrographic criteria without systematic EEG monitoring could have missed ongoing subclinical seizures or misclassified seizure termination; Conducted exclusively in UK emergency departments using one advanced paediatric life support–based pathway and IV phenytoin (rather than fosphenytoin), which may limit generalisability to other health systems, dosing protocols, and practice environments."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this study, major trials such as COURAGE had shown no mortality or MI benefit of routine PCI over optimal medical therapy in stable CAD when guided by angiography alone, leading guidelines to favor medical therapy as initial management in most stable patients. FAME 2 was designed to test whether focusing PCI only on physiologically significant lesions identified by FFR could translate into better outcomes than medical therapy alone, particularly with contemporary drug-eluting stents and guideline-directed secondary prevention.\nIn current practice guidelines (such as contemporary ACC/AHA chronic coronary disease and revascularization guidelines and ESC chronic coronary syndrome guidelines), FFR-based lesion assessment is recommended to guide revascularization decisions in stable CAD when ischemia is uncertain. Subsequent longer-term FAME 2 follow-up has shown sustained reductions in urgent revascularization and signals for benefit in composite outcomes but still limited or modest effects on all-cause mortality, and newer trials like ISCHEMIA and sham-controlled PCI studies such as ORBITA have reinforced that PCI in stable CAD is primarily for symptom relief and reduction of unstable events rather than clear survival benefit. Guidelines generally endorse FFR-guided PCI as reasonable (often class IIa) in stable patients with documented ischemia or persistent angina despite optimal medical therapy, while emphasizing that patients without ischemia can be safely treated with medical therapy alone.",
  "INCLUSION": "Stable angina, stabilized angina pectoris, atypical chest pain or documented silent ischemia, at least one ≥50% stenosis in a major native epicardial coronary artery ≥2.5 mm with viable myocardium, suitable candidate for PCI, FFR ≤0.80 in at least one stenosis for randomization, age ≥21 years",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label, non-blinded design may have biased decisions toward urgent revascularization in the medical-therapy group; trial was stopped early after interim analysis, reducing statistical power for mortality and MI and potentially exaggerating treatment effects on softer endpoints; primary benefit was almost entirely driven by urgent revascularization, with no clear early difference in death or MI, raising questions about impact on hard outcomes; relatively short mean follow-up in the original 2012 report limits conclusions about long-term prognostic benefit; exclusion of high-risk groups (e.g., left main disease, severe LV dysfunction, recent MI, patients requiring CABG) restricts generalizability; all PCI patients received second-generation DES and intensive contemporary medical therapy, so results may not apply to settings with different stent technology or suboptimal medical management; reliance on registry (nonrandomized) comparison for patients without ischemia by FFR limits strength of conclusions for that subgroup",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "The randomized portion of FAME 2 compared two main strategies: FFR-guided PCI plus optimal medical therapy versus optimal medical therapy alone in patients with at least one stenosis with FFR ≤0.80; these two arms are used as the intervention and comparison throughout this summary.

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Patients with T2DM and CKD have high risks of progression to kidney failure and cardiovascular events despite optimal blood pressure and glycemic control with ACEi/ARB-based regimens. Earlier smaller studies showed that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists could reduce albuminuria, but widespread use of steroidal MRAs was limited by hyperkalemia and uncertain effects on hard kidney endpoints in diabetic CKD. FIDELIO-DKD was the first large phase 3 trial to demonstrate that the nonsteroidal, selective MRA finerenone, added to maximally titrated renin–angiotensin system blockade in albuminuric diabetic CKD, reduces a kidney-specific composite outcome and a prespecified cardiovascular composite, findings that underpinned regulatory approval of finerenone for diabetic CKD.\n\nSubsequent evidence, including the complementary FIGARO-DKD cardiovascular outcomes trial and the pooled FIDELITY analysis, has confirmed and extended finerenone’s cardiorenal benefits across a broader CKD spectrum. Contemporary guidelines such as KDIGO 2022 Diabetes in CKD and joint KDIGO/ADA consensus recommendations now endorse a nonsteroidal MRA with proven benefit, typically finerenone, for adults with T2DM, eGFR ≥25 mL/min/1.73 m², normal serum potassium, and persistent albuminuria despite maximally tolerated ACEi/ARB, usually layered on top of SGLT2 inhibitors and often GLP-1 RAs. More recent guidance emphasizes this multipillar strategy while noting ongoing uncertainties about optimal sequencing, use in non-albuminuric or non-diabetic CKD, longer-term safety, and performance in underrepresented populations.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Primary composite outcome was largely driven by the sustained 40% eGFR decline component, whereas harder endpoints such as kidney failure and renal death were infrequent and not individually significant; Generalizability is limited because most participants were older White men with advanced, severely albuminuric diabetic CKD, with relatively few women, Black patients, or patients with earlier-stage or nonalbuminuric CKD; Patients with non-diabetic kidney disease and symptomatic HFrEF were excluded, so results do not directly apply to these groups or to those already receiving steroidal MRAs; Concomitant use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs was uncommon and subgroup analyses suggested possible attenuation or reversal of benefit in those on these agents, leaving uncertainty about safety and incremental benefit with combination therapy; Finerenone approximately doubled the incidence of hyperkalemia compared with placebo and required protocolized monitoring and dose adjustments, which may be challenging to replicate in routine practice; Median follow-up of about 2.6 years may be insufficient to fully assess long-term durability of benefit and late safety signals, including hyperkalemia and rare adverse events."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this study, most guidelines recommended either LABA/ICS or LAMA monotherapy as first-line maintenance for COPD patients at high risk of exacerbations, with relatively little direct evidence comparing LABA/LAMA against LABA/ICS. Concerns about ICS-associated pneumonia risk and uncertainty about which patients truly benefit from ICS created a need for robust head-to-head data. FLAME provided large multicenter evidence that dual long-acting bronchodilation with indacaterol–glycopyrronium reduced overall and moderate/severe exacerbations more effectively than salmeterol–fluticasone, without excess adverse events and with fewer pneumonias, shifting the balance of evidence toward bronchodilator-only combinations for many exacerbation-prone patients.\n\nSubsequent guidelines, including GOLD 2017, incorporated FLAME and related trials (such as WISDOM) to recommend LABA/LAMA combinations as preferred dual therapy for patients with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite monotherapy, and to position LABA/ICS as less favored. More recent GOLD 2023 and 2025 reports further de-emphasize LABA/ICS dual therapy, favoring LABA/LAMA for most patients and reserving ICS for those with frequent exacerbations and higher blood eosinophil counts, typically as part of triple therapy. Overall, newer evidence and current guidelines are consistent with FLAME’s conclusion that many high-risk COPD patients can be managed effectively with dual bronchodilators while minimizing ICS-related pneumonia risk, although ICS-based regimens remain important for selected eosinophilic or highly exacerbation-prone subgroups.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥40 years, current or former smoker with ≥10 pack-years, stable COPD per GOLD criteria on stable maintenance therapy, post-bronchodilator FEV1 25–60% of predicted, post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.70, ≥1 COPD exacerbation in the prior 12 months requiring systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics, mMRC dyspnea grade ≥2",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "The trial was powered and designed as a noninferiority study, with superiority testing performed after noninferiority was established, which raises issues of multiplicity and interpretation of p-values; A 1-week medication washout followed by a 4-week tiotropium run-in led to exclusion of many screened patients and involved withdrawal of prior ICS/LABA or triple therapy before randomization, which may limit generalizability and could influence subsequent exacerbation patterns; Only about one-fifth of participants had ≥2 exacerbations in the prior year, so the results may not fully represent the more severe population for whom guidelines most strongly favor ICS-containing regimens; Many events contributing to the primary endpoint were mild exacerbations, so the impact on the most clinically serious outcomes (severe exacerbations, hospitalizations, mortality) is less pronounced; The comparator used high-dose fluticasone/salmeterol 500/50 µg, a formulation associated with higher pneumonia risk and not the standard COPD dose in some regions, potentially exaggerating pneumonia differences and limiting extrapolation to other ICS/LABA products or lower steroid doses; The study was sponsored by the manufacturer of indacaterol–glycopyrronium and several investigators reported financial relationships, introducing potential risk of sponsorship and publication bias."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this study, management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure without hypercapnia relied largely on conventional oxygen via face mask and noninvasive ventilation, with ongoing debate about the optimal initial strategy and concern that noninvasive ventilation might delay needed intubation or be poorly tolerated. This trial showed that high-flow nasal oxygen achieved similar intubation rates to both standard oxygen and noninvasive ventilation but was associated with more ventilator-free days and lower ICU and 90-day mortality, leading many clinicians to adopt high-flow nasal oxygen as a primary support modality in nonhypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure.\n\nCurrent critical care and respiratory guidelines for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS generally recommend high-flow nasal oxygen as a preferred first-line noninvasive oxygenation strategy in adults without significant hypercapnia, while reserving noninvasive ventilation for selected indications such as COPD or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Subsequent randomized trials and meta-analyses have confirmed the safety and efficacy of high-flow nasal oxygen and often show noninferiority rather than consistent mortality benefit compared with noninvasive ventilation or standard oxygen, so the mortality advantage observed in this trial is now viewed as hypothesis-generating but the trial remains foundational in establishing high-flow nasal oxygen’s role in contemporary practice, including in COVID-19-related hypoxemic respiratory failure.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Primary endpoint was underpowered because actual intubation rates in the standard-oxygen group were lower than anticipated, reducing ability to detect a true difference in intubation; open-label design may have influenced clinical decisions about intubation and escalation of support; mortality benefits were found in secondary outcomes and post hoc analyses, increasing risk of type I error and limiting definitive causal inference; substantial use of three different strategies with potential crossover and clinician discretion may have diluted between-group differences; exclusion of patients with hypercapnia, COPD exacerbations, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, hemodynamic instability, or depressed mental status limits generalizability to many real-world causes of respiratory failure; noninvasive ventilation settings and duration may not reflect optimized contemporary practice and could bias comparisons in favor of high-flow nasal oxygen; the majority of patients had pneumonia and early ARDS, so results may not apply to other etiologies of hypoxemic respiratory failure; subsequent larger trials and meta-analyses have not consistently reproduced a clear mortality advantage of high-flow nasal oxygen, suggesting the mortality signal may be overestimated in this study."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "At the time of FOCUS, the optimal hemoglobin threshold for transfusion in elderly surgical patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors was uncertain, particularly after hip-fracture repair where anemia, frailty, and cardiac events are common. Earlier ICU data had suggested that restrictive thresholds were safe in critically ill patients, but there were lingering concerns that cardiac patients or very elderly orthopedic patients might require higher thresholds to support myocardial oxygen delivery and facilitate rehabilitation. FOCUS provided large, high-quality, randomized data showing that a liberal transfusion threshold of 10 g/dL did not improve mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, or functional recovery compared with a restrictive, symptom-guided strategy, while substantially reducing RBC use, thereby supporting a move toward more restrictive transfusion practices even in this high-risk group.\n\nSubsequent guidelines from transfusion and perioperative societies, including modern AABB and perioperative blood management recommendations, generally endorse restrictive transfusion thresholds (around 7–8 g/dL) in most stable hospitalized adults, with specific support for thresholds near 8 g/dL in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery or with preexisting cardiovascular disease, drawing in part on FOCUS. Later meta-analyses and randomized trials in surgical and cardiac populations have largely confirmed that restrictive strategies are safe and do not worsen mortality or major ischemic outcomes, though some nuance remains for patients with active ischemia or unstable coronary syndromes. Current guidelines do not recommend routine liberal transfusion to maintain hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL in stable postoperative hip-fracture patients, and FOCUS remains a pivotal trial underpinning these restrictive recommendations.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "The between-group difference in hemoglobin levels was modest (~1.3 g/dL), which may limit the ability to detect benefits of more pronounced liberal transfusion; The trial was single-blind, with clinicians aware of treatment allocation, raising potential for performance bias and protocol deviations; Protocol violations occurred in both arms, including transfusions outside the assigned thresholds, which may have attenuated differences between strategies; The study population was predominantly very elderly and white hip-fracture patients, which may limit generalizability to younger patients, other surgical populations, or nonoperative settings; The trial was powered for the composite functional primary outcome but not specifically for less frequent cardiovascular events, limiting conclusions about rare ischemic outcomes; Use of a composite primary endpoint combining death and inability to walk may obscure differential effects on mortality versus functional recovery; Allowing transfusions for symptomatic anemia in both groups could reduce separation between strategies and dilute potential differences in outcomes."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before FOURIER, PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies such as evolocumab were known to lower LDL-C by roughly 60%, but it was uncertain whether this translated into fewer clinical events beyond intensive statin therapy. FOURIER was the first large cardiovascular outcomes trial of a PCSK9 inhibitor in patients with stable ASCVD and showed that further LDL-C lowering well below traditional targets on top of statins reduces major nonfatal cardiovascular events, thereby strengthening the causal link between LDL-C reduction and ASCVD risk and supporting a treat-to-lower paradigm in very high-risk secondary prevention.\n\nCurrent guidelines, including the 2018 ACC/AHA Blood Cholesterol Guideline and the 2019 ESC/EAS Dyslipidaemia Guideline, incorporate FOURIER (together with ODYSSEY OUTCOMES) to recommend PCSK9 inhibitors such as evolocumab for very high-risk ASCVD patients whose LDL-C remains above threshold despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, usually after addition of ezetimibe. Subsequent FOURIER extension studies and meta-analyses have generally confirmed sustained reductions in major cardiovascular events and a reassuring overall safety profile, while independent reanalyses of regulatory data have highlighted a nonsignificant numerical excess in cardiovascular and cardiac deaths and questioned the early stopping of the trial; nonetheless, major guidelines continue to endorse evolocumab in carefully selected high-risk patients, emphasizing stepwise intensification and cost-effectiveness.",

FREEDOM was designed as a definitive, contemporary comparison and showed that, even with aggressive risk factor control and DES, CABG produced lower long-term rates of death and MI than PCI, cementing the concept that surgical bypass offers more durable protection against future ischemic events in this high-risk group.\n\nSubsequent ACC/AHA and ESC/EACTS revascularization guidelines (for example, the ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 coronary revascularization guideline and the ESC/EACTS 2018 myocardial revascularization guideline) explicitly highlight FREEDOM and recommend CABG as the preferred revascularization strategy for most patients with DM and complex multivessel CAD who are suitable surgical candidates, particularly when SYNTAX scores are intermediate or high. Newer data with second-generation DES and improved PCI techniques suggest that the outcome gap may narrow in selected patients, but current major guidelines still regard CABG as the default strategy for diabetic multivessel disease, with PCI reserved for patients with lower anatomic complexity, prohibitive surgical risk, or strong preferences after heart-team discussion.",

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Clostridium difficile infection emerged as a major nosocomial and community problem in the 1990s and 2000s, with rising incidence, severity, and recurrence rates despite standard therapies with metronidazole and vancomycin. This trial provided pivotal evidence that fidaxomicin, a narrow-spectrum macrocyclic antibiotic, can match vancomycin for initial cure while significantly reducing recurrences and improving global cure, especially in non–NAP1/BI/027 infections, thereby shifting the focus from short-term cure to sustained response.\n\nSubsequent guidelines, including the 2014 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidance and the 2017 and 2021 IDSA/SHEA CDI guidelines, have progressively incorporated these data, with the 2021 focused update recommending fidaxomicin as the preferred agent over standard-course vancomycin for initial and recurrent CDI when resources allow. Newer RCTs and meta-analyses have generally confirmed the lower recurrence and improved sustained response with fidaxomicin, while acknowledging cost and limited data in fulminant disease; current guidelines continue to favor fidaxomicin for nonfulminant CDI but still recommend vancomycin-based regimens for fulminant presentations.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥16 years, acute symptomatic CDI, >3 unformed stools in 24 hours, positive stool toxin A and/or B within 48 hours before randomization, primary CDI episode or first recurrence within 3 months, may have received ≤4 doses of metronidazole or vancomycin in prior 24 hours",
  "EXCLUSION": "Life-threatening or fulminant CDI, toxic megacolon, prior exposure to fidaxomicin, history of ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease, more than one CDI episode within the previous 3 months, concomitant potentially effective CDI therapy (e.g., oral bacitracin, fusidic acid, rifaximin), inability to meet protocol treatment duration or follow-up requirements",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Patients with fulminant or life-threatening CDI and those with inflammatory bowel disease were excluded, limiting generalizability to these higher-risk groups; follow-up for recurrence was restricted to 4 weeks after therapy, so later recurrences were not captured; the recurrence benefit of fidaxomicin was attenuated and not statistically significant in infections due to the hypervirulent NAP1/BI/027 strain, raising uncertainty about its advantage in this subgroup; the study was industry-sponsored, and most authors had financial relationships with the fidaxomicin manufacturer, which may introduce potential bias; the trial was conducted only in North America, so applicability to other healthcare settings and strain distributions may be limited; the study was not powered to detect differences in mortality or other rare but important clinical outcomes such as colectomy.",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "The trial included two treatment arms: fidaxomicin 200 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days and vancomycin 125 mg orally every 6 hours for 10 days, both administered in a double-blind fashion. All PICO elements and outcome data in this summary are taken from the comparison of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin using the modified intention-to-treat population, which was the primary analysis set for the main efficacy endpoint."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before HOPE, disease-modifying pharmacologic options for sickle cell disease beyond hydroxyurea were limited, and few therapies directly targeted HbS polymerization. The HOPE trial showed that voxelotor, an oral HbS polymerization inhibitor, can raise hemoglobin and reduce laboratory markers of hemolysis in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease, leading to accelerated regulatory approval in 2019 as the first agent in this class and influencing practice by offering a mechanistically distinct option for patients with persistent anemia despite standard therapy.([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31199090/?utm_source=openai))\n\nEarlier major guidelines (such as the NHLBI sickle cell guidance and ASH 2020 cerebrovascular guidelines) largely predated voxelotor, but subsequent ASH educational pieces and practical guidance documents described it as a disease-modifying option for individuals ≥12 years, particularly those with Hb ≤10.5 g/dL or inadequate response to hydroxyurea. More recent postmarketing trials and real-world data revealed an imbalance in VOCs and deaths in voxelotor-treated patients, leading to voluntary global market withdrawal in 2024; contemporary US practice therefore no longer routinely uses voxelotor, and future guideline updates are expected to downplay or remove its role despite the favorable hematologic effects demonstrated in HOPE.([ashpublications.org](https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/4/8/1554/454384/American-Society-of-Hematology-2020-guidelines-for?utm_source=openai))",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Primary endpoint was a short-term surrogate (hemoglobin response at 24 weeks) rather than VOC rate, organ damage, or survival, limiting direct inference about clinical benefit; Trial was not powered to detect differences in VOC incidence and did not show a statistically significant reduction in VOCs despite improved hemoglobin; Follow-up for the primary analysis was relatively short (24 weeks), providing limited information on long-term safety, durability of effect, or impact on chronic sickle cell complications; Eligibility criteria excluded patients with very frequent VOCs, recent hospitalization, chronic transfusions, or significant hepatic/renal dysfunction, reducing generalizability to the sickest sickle cell populations; Subsequent postmarketing trials and real-world data identified higher VOC and mortality rates with voxelotor compared with control, leading to global withdrawal and raising concerns that the favorable hematologic effects seen in HOPE may not translate into net clinical benefit in routine practice"

  "POPULATION_DETAILS": "Couples in which one partner was HIV-1–positive and the other HIV-1–negative were enrolled at 13 sites in 9 countries. Couples had to be in a stable relationship for at least 3 months, report three or more episodes of vaginal or anal intercourse during that time, and be willing to disclose HIV status to each other. The HIV-1–infected index partner had a screening CD4 count between 350 and 550 cells/mm3 and had not received prior ART other than short-term regimens for prevention of mother-to-child transmission.",
  "INTERVENTION": "Immediate initiation of combination ART (early therapy)",
  "INTERVENTION_DETAILS": "HIV-1–infected index partners in the early-therapy group initiated combination ART at enrollment when CD4 counts were 350–550 cells/mm3, in addition to standard HIV primary care, couples risk-reduction counseling, free condoms, and testing and treatment for STIs. ART consisted of locally available, guideline-concordant regimens using combinations of nucleoside/nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors with either an NNRTI or a boosted PI; drugs used included zidovudine/lamivudine, lamivudine, stavudine, didanosine, tenofovir, emtricitabine/tenofovir, efavirenz, nevirapine, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, and ritonavir, prescribed in prespecified combinations and adjusted per local standards. Women who were pregnant received pregnancy-appropriate ART starting in the second trimester.",
  "COMPARISON": "Deferred initiation of combination ART (delayed therapy)",
  "COMPARISON_DETAILS": "HIV-1–infected index partners in the delayed-therapy group received the same HIV primary care, couples risk-reduction counseling, free condoms, and STI management, but initiation of combination ART was deferred until either two consecutive CD4 counts fell below 250 cells/mm3 or an HIV-related illness consistent with WHO stage 4 or another AIDS-defining event occurred. Once criteria were met, ART regimens were drawn from the same pool of standard combinations used in the early-therapy group and managed according to local treatment guidelines.",
  "OUTCOME": "Linked HIV-1 transmission to the HIV-negative partner; composite clinical endpoint in the HIV-positive partner",
  "OUTCOME_DETAILS": "The primary prevention endpoint was virologically linked HIV-1 transmission to the initially HIV-1–negative partner, determined by genetic linkage of viruses.

  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "The trial compared two ART-timing strategies for HIV-1–infected partners in serodiscordant couples: immediate initiation of combination ART at CD4 350–550 cells/mm3 (early therapy) versus deferral of ART until CD4 <250 cells/mm3 or development of HIV-related illness (delayed therapy). These two arms form the core comparison of interest and are therefore used as the intervention and comparator throughout the PICO, outcomes, and summary fields.",
  "CLINICALQUESTION": "In HIV-1–infected adults in serodiscordant couples with CD4 350–550 cells/mm3, does immediate initiation of combination ART compared with deferring ART until CD4 <250 cells/mm3 or HIV-related illness reduce virologically linked HIV-1 transmission to the HIV-negative partner and improve the composite clinical endpoint of TB, severe bacterial infection, WHO stage 4 disease, or death?",
  "CLINICALQUESTION_simple": "In HIV-positive adults in serodiscordant couples, does starting ART early instead of waiting until more advanced immunosuppression improve HIV transmission and clinical outcomes?",
  "BOTTOMLINE": "Early initiation of combination ART in HIV-1–infected adults in serodiscordant couples almost eliminated virologically linked sexual transmission to the HIV-negative partner and reduced serious HIV-related clinical events compared with deferring ART until CD4 decline or advanced disease. These findings established early ART as both an individual treatment and a powerful prevention strategy in this population.",

  ],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this study, observational data suggested that combination ART might reduce sexual transmission of HIV by lowering plasma and genital tract viral load, but there was uncertainty about the magnitude of effect and optimal timing of ART for both individual health and public health prevention. HPTN 052 provided the first randomized controlled trial evidence that initiating ART at higher CD4 counts in serodiscordant couples dramatically reduces linked HIV transmission while also decreasing serious HIV-related clinical events, and it was widely recognized as a landmark demonstration of “treatment as prevention.”\nMajor international guidelines rapidly incorporated these findings. WHO and US guideline panels cited this trial in progressively moving from CD4-based ART thresholds toward recommending ART for all people living with HIV regardless of CD4 count, and the study laid key groundwork for the modern principle that sustained viral suppression effectively prevents sexual transmission. Subsequent studies in other populations and risk groups have confirmed and extended the conclusion that suppressive ART provides durable protection against HIV transmission, and contemporary guidelines endorse early or immediate ART initiation both to improve individual outcomes and to support population-level HIV prevention strategies; none of the major guidelines have contradicted the main conclusions of HPTN 052.",
  "INCLUSION": "HIV-1 serodiscordant couple, stable relationship ≥3 months, ≥3 episodes of vaginal or anal intercourse in prior 3 months, willingness to disclose HIV status to partner, age ≥18 years, HIV-1–infected index partner with CD4 350–550 cells/mm3, no prior ART except short-term regimens for prevention of mother-to-child transmission",
  "EXCLUSION": "Prior combination ART for chronic HIV treatment, CD4 count outside 350–550 cells/mm3 at screening, unwillingness to disclose HIV status within the couple, inability to provide informed consent or comply with study procedures",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design without blinding could influence reporting of symptoms and behaviors; Majority of couples were heterosexual and in relatively stable relationships, limiting generalizability to MSM, people with multiple or casual partners, or those with less stable partnerships; Intensive counseling, free condoms, and comprehensive clinical support in the trial may not reflect real-world program settings, potentially inflating observed prevention benefits; ART regimens used were based on older drugs and combinations, so toxicity profiles and adherence patterns may differ from current first-line regimens; The interim analysis led to early modification of the deferred arm, which may introduce complexities in long-term comparative estimates and reduces power for later endpoints; Participants were required to have relatively preserved immune function at baseline, so findings may not fully apply to individuals presenting with very low CD4 counts or acute infection."

Detailed arm-specific sample sizes and event rates beyond those reported for the low-risk group were not available from accessible sources, so no formal comparative effect measures are provided.",
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "High-sensitivity troponin assays were developed to improve early detection of myocardial injury and reduce the diagnostic blind spot that existed with older assays in the first hours after symptom onset. This study was among the first large real-world evaluations suggesting that a single, very low hs-cTnT value below the limit of detection combined with a non-ischemic ECG could safely rule out MI with extremely high negative predictive value, challenging the long-standing requirement for routine serial troponins in all ED chest-pain presentations and supporting more efficient use of inpatient beds.\nSubsequent cohort studies, meta-analyses, and international guidelines have generally endorsed rapid rule-out strategies with hs-cTn, including single-sample approaches using values below the assay limit of detection (or limit of quantitation where regulatory constraints apply) together with non-ischemic ECG and clinical assessment. Contemporary ESC non-ST-elevation ACS guidelines, the ACC/AHA 2021 chest pain guideline, and more recent emergency medicine policy statements now highlight hs-cTn-based rapid diagnostic algorithms (0/1-hour, 0/2-hour, and select single-sample strategies) as preferred approaches. Later evidence has confirmed the excellent safety of low cutoffs but has also emphasized limitations in very early presenters and in patients with high baseline risk or comorbidities such as renal dysfunction; current recommendations therefore integrate hs-cTn thresholds with clinical risk assessment rather than relying on biomarkers alone.",

  "EXCLUSION": null,
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Non-randomized single-center Swedish cohort limits generalizability to other health systems and populations; Retrospective observational design using clinically ordered hs-cTnT introduces potential selection bias and unmeasured confounding; Management decisions were not actually guided by the proposed single-sample rule-out strategy, so downstream outcomes under a true discharge protocol are inferred rather than directly tested; Very early presenters after symptom onset may have been underrepresented among patients with undetectable hs-cTnT, limiting certainty about safety of a single measurement in this subgroup; Use of a single assay (Roche hs-cTnT) and a specific limit-of-detection threshold (<5 ng/L) means results may not extrapolate to other hs-cTn assays or regulatory environments that mandate use of higher limits of quantitation; Subsequent commentaries noted that while short-term MI and mortality risk is minimal, long-term cardiovascular risk in patients with low but detectable hs-cTnT remains higher than in those with undetectable values, so broader prognostic implications are not captured by this study alone."

  "INTERVENTION_DETAILS": "Patients were assigned to combination therapy with ezetimibe 10 mg orally once daily plus simvastatin 40 mg orally once daily, started soon after hospitalization for ACS. Before a protocol amendment in 2011, if on-treatment LDL-C remained >2.0 mmol/L on two consecutive measurements, simvastatin could be uptitrated to 80 mg daily; if LDL-C remained >2.6 mmol/L on two consecutive measurements, study drug was discontinued and open-label lipid-lowering therapy initiated, with outcomes still captured in the intention-to-treat analysis. Background guideline-directed ACS medications were continued at the discretion of treating physicians.",

  "COMPARISON_DETAILS": "Patients in the control arm received simvastatin 40 mg orally once daily plus matching placebo to ezetimibe. The same LDL-C–driven protocol applied: prior to the 2011 amendment, simvastatin could be increased to 80 mg daily if LDL-C remained >2.0 mmol/L on two consecutive measurements, and persistent LDL-C >2.6 mmol/L led to discontinuation of blinded study drug and use of open-label lipid-lowering therapy, with continued follow-up for outcomes.",

  "BOTTOMLINE": "In high-risk post-ACS patients on moderate-intensity simvastatin, adding ezetimibe 10 mg daily produced a small but statistically significant reduction in major cardiovascular events compared with simvastatin alone.

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this study, statins were the only lipid-lowering drugs with robust evidence for improving hard cardiovascular outcomes, and multiple nonstatin agents had failed to add clinical benefit when combined with statins. IMPROVE-IT was designed to test whether further LDL-C reduction with ezetimibe added to moderate-intensity simvastatin would translate into fewer cardiovascular events in high-risk post-ACS patients whose baseline LDL-C was already near or below then-current targets, thereby directly testing the \"lower is better\" LDL hypothesis using a nonstatin mechanism.\n\nThe modest but significant reduction in major cardiovascular events seen in IMPROVE-IT helped establish ezetimibe as a validated nonstatin add-on therapy and reinforced the concept that incremental LDL-C lowering confers additional risk reduction, even at relatively low LDL levels. Contemporary guidelines such as the 2018 ACC/AHA Multisociety Cholesterol Guideline and the 2019 ESC/EAS Dyslipidaemia Guidelines recommend ezetimibe as the first-line nonstatin add-on to maximally tolerated statin therapy in very high-risk ASCVD patients whose LDL-C remains above target, with subsequent consideration of PCSK9 inhibitors based on residual risk and cost; later outcome trials of PCSK9 inhibitors have confirmed and extended the \"lower is better\" paradigm but have not negated the role of ezetimibe demonstrated in IMPROVE-IT.",

  "EXCLUSION": "CABG performed for the qualifying ACS, planned CABG, clinically unstable status (e.g., cardiogenic shock, severe decompensated HF, acute MR or VSD), recurrent ischemia or significant arrhythmias (e.g., VF, sustained VT, high-grade AV block), current statin therapy more potent than simvastatin 40 mg, creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, active liver disease",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Absolute risk reduction in the primary composite endpoint was small, so clinical benefit—while statistically significant—is modest in magnitude; High rates of premature discontinuation of study drug and cross-over to open-label lipid-lowering therapy may have diluted treatment effects and complicate interpretation; Use of moderate-intensity simvastatin (with limited uptitration to 80 mg) does not fully reflect current practice with high-intensity statins, which may limit generalizability; The enrolled population consisted of relatively stable, older post-ACS patients with moderately elevated LDL-C, so findings may not apply to lower-risk primary-prevention patients or those with very high LDL-C; The trial was industry-funded by the manufacturer of ezetimibe, raising potential concerns about sponsor bias despite blinded design and adjudicated outcomes."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before INPULSIS, treatment options for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were limited and largely ineffective, with prior immunosuppressive regimens ultimately shown to be harmful. The INPULSIS trials, together with the pirfenidone ASCEND program, provided the first large, high-quality evidence that antifibrotic therapy could significantly slow FVC decline in IPF, shifting the therapeutic goal from symptom relief alone toward modifying disease progression and leading to regulatory approval of nintedanib as one of the first disease-modifying agents for IPF.\nContemporary international guidelines such as the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT IPF guideline (2015 and subsequent updates) and more recent ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidance on IPF and progressive pulmonary fibrosis recommend nintedanib as a standard antifibrotic option for appropriate patients with IPF, based largely on INPULSIS and confirmatory pooled and extension data. Subsequent trials in systemic sclerosis–associated ILD and progressive fibrosing ILDs have expanded indications but have generally corroborated the core INPULSIS conclusion that nintedanib slows FVC decline; current guidelines continue to endorse its use while acknowledging ongoing uncertainty regarding long-term survival benefit and optimal patient selection.",

  "EXCLUSION": "Known increased risk of bleeding or need for full-dose therapeutic anticoagulation, requirement for high-dose antiplatelet therapy, recent myocardial infarction, recent stroke or transient ischemic attack, recent unstable angina or other significant uncontrolled cardiac disease, significant hepatic impairment, other clinically significant lung disease that could confound IPF assessment, any condition likely to limit adherence or survival over the 52-week trial",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Enrolled patients had relatively preserved lung function (FVC ≥50%, DLCO 30–79%), limiting generalizability to patients with very advanced IPF; Follow-up was limited to 52 weeks, providing inadequate power to detect long-term mortality or transplant benefits; The primary endpoint (FVC decline) is a surrogate measure of disease progression rather than a direct clinical outcome such as survival or hospitalization; Effects on key secondary endpoints were inconsistent between the two trials, with benefit for acute exacerbations and SGRQ evident only in INPULSIS-2 and not in INPULSIS-1; High rates of gastrointestinal adverse events, especially diarrhea, may affect adherence and tolerability in routine practice; Exclusion of patients with substantial cardiovascular comorbidities or high bleeding risk limits the ability to fully assess safety and efficacy in these common real-world populations."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this trial, recommendations on when to initiate ART in asymptomatic HIV infection with high CD4 counts were inconsistent and based largely on observational data, with concerns that earlier treatment might expose patients to long-term toxicities without clear clinical benefit. START provided high-quality randomized evidence that early ART initiation at CD4 >500 cells/mm³ improves both AIDS and non-AIDS clinical outcomes without added serious toxicity, helping shift practice from CD4-threshold-based initiation to a universal early-treatment approach.\n\nMajor international HIV treatment guidelines, including those from the World Health Organization, the US Department of Health and Human Services, the International Antiviral Society–USA, and the European AIDS Clinical Society, now recommend offering ART to all people with HIV regardless of CD4 count, and they explicitly cite early-ART evidence such as START in support of a “treat all” strategy. Subsequent follow-up of the START cohort and other contemporary studies have reinforced the durability of clinical benefit and the lack of major long-term safety signals with early ART, so current guidelines continue to endorse immediate ART initiation at diagnosis as standard of care.",

  "EXCLUSION": "History of AIDS, prior antiretroviral therapy, pregnancy at screening, breastfeeding at screening",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Mean follow-up of about 3 years is relatively short compared with lifelong ART, limiting assessment of very long-term benefits and toxicities, especially for individual non–AIDS conditions such as cardiovascular disease or specific cancers; The enrolled cohort was relatively young and healthy with high CD4 counts and low event rates, reducing power for some secondary outcomes and potentially limiting generalizability to older patients or those with significant comorbidities; Trial participation required willingness and ability to adhere to protocol and follow-up, so results may not fully reflect outcomes in patients with substantial adherence barriers or unstable engagement in care; The study was conducted in research settings with close monitoring and high-quality care, which may not be fully replicated in resource-limited or routine practice environments; ART regimens were predominantly efavirenz- plus tenofovir/emtricitabine–based combinations typical of the study era, so while the timing-of-initiation findings are likely generalizable, regimen-specific toxicity profiles may differ from those of current integrase inhibitor–based first-line therapies."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before ISCHEMIA, several strategy trials in stable ischemic heart disease (such as COURAGE, BARI 2D, and FFR-guided PCI studies) suggested that adding revascularization to optimal medical therapy did not clearly reduce death or myocardial infarction, but many clinicians still believed that patients with moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing derived prognostic benefit from early invasive management. ISCHEMIA was designed to address these gaps by enrolling patients with at least moderate ischemia, using blinded coronary CT angiography to exclude left main and nonobstructive disease, and comparing an early invasive strategy plus contemporary guideline-directed therapy versus a conservative strategy of intensive medical therapy alone.\n\nISCHEMIA reinforced and extended prior evidence by showing no overall reduction in major cardiovascular events or mortality with an initial invasive strategy in this population, while separate ISCHEMIA health-status analyses demonstrated greater angina and quality-of-life improvement in symptomatic patients who underwent invasive management. Contemporary guidelines, including the 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization and the 2023 AHA/ACC Multisociety Guideline for Chronic Coronary Disease, incorporate these findings by emphasizing optimal medical therapy and shared decision-making as the default approach for stable CAD, reserving revascularization primarily for patients with unacceptable angina despite medical therapy or for specific high-risk anatomical scenarios. Longer-term ISCHEMIA-EXTEND follow-up has continued to show no difference in all-cause mortality between invasive and conservative strategies, with offsetting differences in cardiovascular versus noncardiovascular death, so current guidelines continue to view the prognostic impact of routine early invasive management in this setting as neutral while recognizing its role in symptom relief.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Sample size was reduced from the originally planned 8000 to 5179 participants, event rates were lower than expected, and median follow-up of 3.2 years was modest, reducing statistical power and increasing uncertainty about longer-term effects; The primary endpoint was modified and expanded according to a prespecified contingency plan in response to slow recruitment and low event rates, which complicates interpretation of the composite results; Trial findings do not apply to key higher-risk groups such as patients with recent acute coronary syndromes, significant unprotected left main disease, LVEF <35%, NYHA class III–IV heart failure, or severe refractory angina, limiting generalizability; Approximately 14% of randomized patients did not meet the protocol-defined ischemia severity threshold on core laboratory review, so some participants had only mild or no ischemia, potentially diluting any benefit in truly high-ischemia patients; Results were sensitive to the definition of myocardial infarction used, with an alternative procedural MI definition shifting the apparent balance of early risk and benefit for the invasive strategy and complicating interpretation of MI-driven composites; Completeness and method of revascularization (PCI versus CABG) were not fully analyzed at the time of the main report, leaving uncertainty about whether more complete or differently selected revascularization might have altered outcomes."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before the advent of targeted BTK inhibitors, FCR chemoimmunotherapy was the standard first-line regimen for younger, fit CLL patients, particularly those with mutated IGHV, based on prior trials demonstrating durable remissions and potential cure in a subset. The E1912 trial tested whether an ibrutinib-based regimen could outperform this benchmark and demonstrated clear superiority of ibrutinib–rituximab over FCR for progression-free and overall survival, especially in IGHV-unmutated disease, which rapidly shifted practice toward targeted therapy in this population.\n\nSubsequent updates to major guidelines, including NCCN CLL/SLL guidelines, iwCLL recommendations, and other national guidance documents, incorporated E1912 results by elevating BTK inhibitor–based regimens to preferred first-line options for most CLL patients and relegating FCR largely to a niche role in young, fit patients with IGHV-mutated, standard-risk disease who desire finite chemoimmunotherapy. More recent data with second-generation BTK inhibitors and time-limited venetoclax-based combinations, along with extended E1912 follow-up showing sustained benefit but cumulative ibrutinib toxicities, have led current guidelines to favor newer BTK inhibitors or venetoclax–obinutuzumab over ibrutinib–rituximab, but the E1912 trial remains pivotal in establishing the inferiority of FCR for the majority of younger patients.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design without blinding, which may influence reporting and management of adverse events; Interim analysis with relatively short median follow-up and few deaths when the overall survival benefit was first reported, making the durability of the survival advantage initially uncertain; Exclusion of patients with del(17p13) and those older than 70 years or with significant cardiac comorbidity limits generalizability to higher-risk and older CLL populations; Ibrutinib was administered as continuous indefinite therapy whereas FCR was fixed-duration, so differences in long-term toxicity, adherence, and economic impact of prolonged BTK inhibition were not fully addressed; Chemoimmunotherapy achieved higher complete remission and MRD-negativity rates, particularly in IGHV-mutated patients, leaving uncertainty about the optimal strategy for favorable-risk younger patients who may prefer time-limited therapy; The regimen evaluated combines ibrutinib with rituximab even though other randomized data suggest minimal incremental benefit from adding rituximab to ibrutinib, so the specific contribution of rituximab in this trial remains debatable"

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Intensive glycemic control in T2DM had shown clear microvascular benefits but uncertain macrovascular advantage, and regulators required that new glucose-lowering agents demonstrate cardiovascular safety after concerns with earlier drugs. LEADER was designed as an event-driven cardiovascular outcomes trial in high-risk T2DM patients to establish the cardiovascular safety of liraglutide and unexpectedly demonstrated reductions in major cardiovascular events and mortality, making it the first GLP-1 receptor agonist to show such benefits and complementing findings from the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin.\n\nSubsequent cardiovascular outcomes trials of other GLP-1 receptor agonists and meta-analyses have largely confirmed a class effect on atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, with liraglutide consistently among agents demonstrating mortality benefit. Current guidelines, including the ADA Standards of Care and the 2019 ESC/EASD diabetes and cardiovascular disease guidelines, recommend GLP-1 receptor agonists with proven cardiovascular benefit—explicitly naming liraglutide—for patients with T2DM and established ASCVD or very high/high cardiovascular risk to reduce cardiovascular events and death, and newer evidence has refined but not contradicted LEADER’s conclusion, extending its findings into broader routine-care populations.",
  "INCLUSION": "T2DM, Age ≥50 with established CVD, cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial disease, CKD or chronic HF, or age ≥60 with at least one CV risk factor (e.g., microalbuminuria/proteinuria, hypertension, LVH, LV dysfunction, ABI <0.9), HbA1c ≥7.0%, On stable background glucose-lowering therapy or antidiabetic drug-naive",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Follow-up was limited to approximately 3.5–5.0 years, so long-term efficacy and safety of liraglutide beyond this period are uncertain; The study population consisted of patients with T2DM, HbA1c ≥7%, and high CV risk, so results may not be generalizable to lower-risk patients or those with shorter diabetes duration; No statistical adjustment was made for multiplicity of numerous exploratory and subgroup analyses, increasing the chance that some secondary or subgroup results are spurious; The trial was not powered to assess cancer risk, and small, nonsignificant imbalances in pancreatic malignancies mean that long-term malignancy risk cannot be excluded."

Contemporary guidelines for AML/APL management, including major European and North American recommendations, now endorse ATRA+arsenic trioxide as the preferred frontline regimen for non–high-risk APL, while ongoing work refines its use in high-risk, pediatric, and older or comorbid patients; no major guideline disputes the core conclusion of this trial, although they note that data are limited for populations excluded from APL0406.",

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Pleural infection and empyema carry substantial morbidity and mortality, and effective drainage of infected pleural fluid is central to management. Earlier large randomized data with intrapleural streptokinase failed to show clinical benefit, leading to skepticism about fibrinolytics despite observational experience. MIST2 tested a mechanistically rational combination of a direct fibrinolytic (tPA) and DNase to break down fibrinous septations and reduce fluid viscosity, demonstrating that the combination, but not either agent alone, improves radiographic clearance and important clinical outcomes, thereby reviving interest in medical intrapleural therapy as an alternative or adjunct to surgery.\nContemporary pleural disease and empyema guidelines (such as the British Thoracic Society pleural disease guidelines and the American Association for Thoracic Surgery empyema guidelines) acknowledge intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy, with more recent expert statements specifically referencing tPA/DNase as a reasonable option for patients with loculated pleural infection who fail initial tube drainage or are poor surgical candidates. Subsequent observational studies and economic analyses have generally supported the effectiveness and acceptable safety of the MIST2 regimen, although some guidelines still prioritize early surgical intervention (e.g., VATS) in operable patients and recommend tPA/DNase as an adjunct or alternative, rather than routine first-line treatment for all cases.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥18 years, clinical evidence of pleural infection (e.g., fever, elevated WBC, elevated inflammatory markers), pleural fluid requiring drainage that was purulent or Gram stain positive or culture positive or pleural pH <7.2, pleural opacity occupying at least a small but clinically significant portion of the hemithorax on imaging",
  "EXCLUSION": "Age <18 years, prior intrapleural fibrinolytic or DNase therapy for the index empyema, known hypersensitivity to tPA or DNase, coincidental stroke, major hemorrhage or major trauma, major surgery within the previous 5 days, previous pneumonectomy on the infected side, pregnancy or lactation, expected survival <3 months from another underlying disease, very small pleural effusion (pleural opacity <5% of hemithorax), inability to provide informed consent",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Relatively small overall sample size and modest numbers per arm, limiting power for hard clinical endpoints such as mortality; primary endpoint was radiographic change in pleural opacity rather than a purely clinical outcome, raising questions about the direct clinical relevance of the primary measure; modified intention-to-treat analysis excluded some randomized patients, potentially introducing bias; trial population was mostly from UK centers with a high prevalence of loculated infections and use of small-bore drains, which may limit generalizability to other settings or patient groups; regimen requires multiple intrapleural instillations, careful clamp management, and use of expensive agents, which may affect feasibility and cost-effectiveness in routine practice; bleeding events were infrequent but the study was underpowered to fully characterize hemorrhagic risk, especially in higher-risk patients; longer-term outcomes beyond 12 months and optimal patient selection criteria for tPA/DNase versus early surgery remain uncertain.",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "MIST2 used a 2x2 factorial design with four groups: tPA+DNase, tPA+placebo, DNase+placebo, and double placebo. For clarity and because the main clinical signal was observed only with combination therapy, the PICO and outcome summaries here focus on the tPA+DNase combination arm versus the double placebo arm, which represents the most clinically relevant comparison to standard care."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Recurrent CDI is common after standard antibiotic therapy and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization. Before MODIFY I and II, smaller phase 2 data suggested that monoclonal antibodies against C. difficile toxins could reduce recurrences, but the optimal target (toxin A, toxin B, or both) and definitive clinical benefit remained uncertain. MODIFY I and II provided large, well-controlled phase 3 evidence that passive immunization against toxin B with bezlotoxumab, given alongside standard antibiotics, meaningfully lowers recurrence risk without compromising initial clinical cure. They also demonstrated that adding anti–toxin A (actoxumab) did not improve efficacy and that actoxumab monotherapy carried potential safety concerns, focusing subsequent practice and development on bezlotoxumab alone.\n\nSince publication, these trials have strongly influenced CDI management, particularly in patients at high risk of recurrence. The IDSA/SHEA 2021 CDI focused update recommends bezlotoxumab as an adjunct to standard antibiotics for adults with a CDI episode and recent recurrence within 6 months, and suggests considering it for primary episodes with major risk factors such as age ≥65 years, immunocompromise, or severe CDI, while cautioning about use in patients with preexisting congestive heart failure. Subsequent subgroup analyses and real-world cohorts have generally confirmed reduced recurrence and fewer CDI-associated readmissions, especially in multi-risk-factor populations, although high acquisition cost, limited data in patients treated with fidaxomicin, and logistical barriers to IV administration have moderated uptake. Overall, current guidelines view bezlotoxumab as an effective but targeted adjunctive option rather than routine therapy for all CDI cases.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age 18–99 years, diagnosis of CDI with ≥3 loose stools in 24 hours, positive stool test for toxigenic C. difficile, receiving or planning to receive a 10–14 day course of standard-of-care CDI antibiotics (oral metronidazole, oral vancomycin, or oral fidaxomicin, with or without IV metronidazole)",
  "EXCLUSION": "Active chronic diarrheal illness causing baseline loose stools (e.g., ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, ostomy with routinely loose output), planned surgery for CDI within 24 hours, prior exposure to actoxumab or bezlotoxumab (MK-3415, MK-6072, or combination), receipt of immune globulin within 6 months before infusion or planned during the 12-week follow-up, planned CDI antibiotic regimen longer than 14 days (e.g., tapered or pulsed vancomycin), use of other preventive therapies for recurrent CDI such as fecal microbiota transplantation during the trial",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Standard-of-care antibiotic choice (metronidazole, vancomycin, fidaxomicin) and dosing schedules were not standardized and were left to investigators, potentially introducing treatment heterogeneity despite stratification; The timing between CDI symptom onset, start of antibiotics, and bezlotoxumab infusion varied widely, limiting the ability to assess effects on severity and duration of the initial episode; Baseline CDI severity was likely underestimated because most participants had already started antibiotics when severity scoring was performed; Other preventive strategies for recurrent CDI (such as fecal microbiota transplantation or extended/tapered vancomycin) were not allowed, so the interaction and comparative effectiveness of bezlotoxumab versus or in combination with these approaches remain unknown; Safety follow-up and sample size, while large for an antibody trial, were still relatively limited for detecting very rare serious adverse events, and actoxumab monotherapy showed higher mortality and serious adverse events without a clear mechanistic explanation; Representation of patients treated with fidaxomicin as the background antibiotic was low, so the degree of additive benefit with modern fidaxomicin-based regimens is uncertain; Subsequent economic and implementation analyses have raised concerns about high drug cost, infusion logistics, and variable insurance coverage, which may limit real-world applicability despite clinical efficacy; Later regulatory and guideline commentary has highlighted a potential signal for worsening heart failure in patients with preexisting congestive heart failure, leading to caution and a recommendation to reserve bezlotoxumab for cases where anticipated benefit clearly outweighs this potential risk in that subgroup."

Intra-arterial thrombolysis used alteplase or urokinase; patients pretreated with IV alteplase could receive at most an additional 30 mg alteplase or 400,000 IU urokinase intra-arterially, with a maximum of 1,200,000 IU urokinase in patients without prior IV alteplase. Mechanical techniques included thrombus retraction, aspiration, wire disruption, and devices such as retrievable stents; in the trial, retrievable stents were used in approximately 82% of treated patients.

A key secondary clinical outcome was functional independence at 90 days, defined as mRS 0–2. Major safety outcomes included mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and the trial also evaluated imaging-based recanalization and infarct size, as well as early neurological scores.

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "At the time MR CLEAN was conducted, IV alteplase was the only established reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke, and several prior endovascular trials using older devices or without mandatory vessel imaging had been neutral, creating uncertainty about the value of intra-arterial therapy. MR CLEAN was the first randomized trial to require proven large-vessel anterior circulation occlusion and to use predominantly modern stent-retriever technology in a pragmatic design, demonstrating a clear functional benefit without excess mortality or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage; this result overturned earlier pessimism about endovascular stroke therapy and triggered early stopping or redesign of contemporaneous trials that subsequently confirmed the benefit.\n\nCurrent stroke guidelines, including major updates from North American and European societies (such as AHA/ASA 2015 and 2018 ischemic stroke guidelines and subsequent European stroke guidelines), explicitly recommend endovascular mechanical thrombectomy for eligible patients with anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion within defined time windows, largely on the basis of MR CLEAN and the cluster of positive trials that followed. Later studies (e.g., ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, SWIFT PRIME, REVASCAT, and extended-window trials like DAWN and DEFUSE 3) have refined patient selection and extended treatment windows, but overall they have reinforced and expanded the conclusion that timely mechanical thrombectomy, often combined with IV alteplase when appropriate, provides substantial and durable functional benefit; no major contemporary guideline omits or contradicts this recommendation for appropriate candidates.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥18 years, acute ischemic stroke with NIHSS ≥2, proximal symptomatic occlusion of distal intracranial ICA, M1, M2, or A1 in anterior circulation on CTA/MRA/DSA, CT or MRI excluding intracranial hemorrhage, ability to start intra-arterial treatment within 6 hours of symptom onset, eligible for usual-care stroke management including IV alteplase if indicated",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label treatment with only blinded outcome assessment, creating potential for performance bias; heterogeneous intra-arterial techniques and thrombolytic regimens allowed at operator discretion, limiting conclusions about any specific device or drug strategy; relatively modest recanalization and good-outcome rates compared with later trials using more standardized, optimized thrombectomy workflows; potential learning-curve effects across participating centers as modern endovascular techniques were being adopted; pragmatic inclusion without strict imaging-based core/penumbra selection or ASPECTS limits may have diluted treatment effect in patients with large established infarcts; sample size adequate for the primary shift outcome but less robust for detailed subgroup and safety analyses; conducted entirely in the Netherlands, which may modestly limit generalizability to systems with very different stroke networks and prehospital logistics"

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before MSLT-1, management of regional lymph nodes in melanoma oscillated between routine elective lymph node dissection and simple observation, with randomized trials suggesting at best modest benefits from elective dissection at the cost of significant morbidity. MSLT-1 was designed to test whether sentinel lymph node biopsy could selectively identify patients with occult nodal metastases who might benefit from immediate completion lymphadenectomy, and whether this biopsy-directed approach could improve survival compared with nodal observation. Its final report showed that while overall melanoma-specific survival was similar between groups, sentinel-node status was the strongest prognostic factor, biopsy-based management improved disease-free survival, and early treatment of occult nodal disease in intermediate-thickness melanomas improved distant disease–free and melanoma-specific survival among node-positive patients, helping to cement SLN biopsy as a standard staging procedure in melanoma.\n\nCurrent melanoma guidelines, including major US and international recommendations, explicitly endorse SLN biopsy for patients with clinically node-negative intermediate-thickness melanomas and generally recommend consideration of the procedure in thick melanomas, largely on the basis of MSLT-1 and related data. Subsequent evidence, particularly from MSLT-II and other trials, has shown no overall survival benefit from routine completion lymphadenectomy for positive SLNs despite better regional control, leading modern guidelines to favor nodal ultrasound surveillance instead of mandatory CLND in most SLN-positive patients. Thus, MSLT-1 remains foundational for the prognostic and disease-free survival benefits of SLN biopsy and for patient selection, while current practice integrates its findings with newer data to limit the extent of nodal surgery in the era of effective systemic therapies.",
  "INCLUSION": "Localized primary cutaneous melanoma, Clark level III with Breslow thickness ≥1.00 mm or Clark level IV–V with any Breslow thickness, intermediate-thickness primary melanoma 1.20–3.50 mm (primary study cohort), clinically negative regional lymph nodes at baseline, no evidence of distant metastasis, eligible for wide local excision and either SLN biopsy or nodal observation, enrollment within a limited interval after initial diagnostic biopsy (approximately within 10 weeks in MSLT-I protocols)",
  "EXCLUSION": "Melanoma not meeting specified Breslow thickness or Clark level criteria, clinical evidence of regional nodal metastasis, evidence of distant metastatic disease at baseline, inability to undergo wide local excision and protocol-directed nodal management, enrollment beyond the permitted interval after initial melanoma biopsy",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "No significant improvement in 10-year melanoma-specific survival was demonstrated in the overall randomized population despite improved disease-free survival; Survival benefit in intermediate-thickness melanomas was confined to the subset with nodal metastases and relies on subgroup and latent-subgroup analyses that are vulnerable to ascertainment, lead-time, and selection biases; Data for patients with thin melanomas (<1.20 mm) were accrued but not fully reported in the final article, limiting transparency and external appraisal of that cohort; Long-term outcomes were influenced by subsequent therapies and practice patterns over many years, which may confound pure surgical effects and reduce applicability to contemporary systemic therapy eras; Completion lymphadenectomy was associated with substantial morbidity, and the trial did not anticipate later evidence from MSLT-II and other studies showing that routine CLND for positive SLNs confers no overall survival advantage, leading some commentators to question the therapeutic interpretation of MSLT-1; Critics have argued that key trial data remain incompletely reported and that the trial does not support a survival benefit for SLN biopsy in the overall intermediate-thickness group, challenging claims that MSLT-1 is definitively practice-changing for survival rather than primarily for staging and prognostication."

  "POPULATION_DETAILS": "Adults and adolescents presenting to six metropolitan emergency departments after single or staggered acetaminophen overdose, who were started on IV NAC and met low-risk criteria on serial laboratory testing: normal alanine transaminase (ALT) and creatinine at presentation and again at 12 hours after NAC initiation, and a serum acetaminophen concentration less than 20 mg/L at 12 hours. Of 449 acetaminophen overdoses receiving NAC during the study period, 100 low-risk patients fulfilling these criteria were enrolled.",
  "INTERVENTION": "Abbreviated 12-hour IV NAC regimen with early cessation based on 12-hour laboratory results.",
  "INTERVENTION_DETAILS": "Patients received IV acetylcysteine using a two-bag regimen with a planned total of 250 mg/kg over 12 hours: 200 mg/kg over the first 4 hours followed by a continuous infusion of 6.25 mg/kg/h (50 mg/kg over the next 8 hours). At 12 hours from NAC initiation, ALT, creatinine, and acetaminophen concentration were rechecked; if ALT was less than 40 IU/L, creatinine remained within the normal range, and acetaminophen was less than 20 mg/L, NAC was discontinued after 12 hours. Patients who failed these laboratory stop criteria were excluded from the NACSTOP analysis and continued NAC to complete the standard 300 mg/kg course.",
  "COMPARISON": "Standard 20-hour IV NAC regimen without protocolized early cessation.",
  "COMPARISON_DETAILS": "Patients at comparison sites received the standard two-bag 20-hour IV acetylcysteine regimen totaling 300 mg/kg: 200 mg/kg over 4 hours followed by 100 mg/kg over 16 hours (6.25 mg/kg/h), with treatment generally continued for the full 20 hours irrespective of interim laboratory values, and follow-up labs at around 20 hours to determine the need for any additional NAC beyond the initial course.",
  "OUTCOME": "Incidence of hepatic injury 20 hours after initiation of NAC.",
  "OUTCOME_DETAILS": "The primary outcome was hepatic injury at 20 hours, defined as both a doubling of ALT from baseline and a peak ALT greater than 100 IU/L, indicating a need for further antidotal treatment. Key secondary outcomes included incidence of hepatotoxicity (ALT >1,000 IU/L), peak international normalized ratio (INR), and frequency of adverse drug reactions to NAC, as well as clinical follow-up to 14 days for liver injury, death, or other serious outcomes.",
  "INTERVENTION_N": "50",
  "COMPARISON_N": "50",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "The trial compared two NAC regimens only: an abbreviated 12-hour, 250 mg/kg two-bag infusion with early cessation based on 12-hour labs versus the standard 20-hour, 300 mg/kg two-bag infusion. These two prespecified groups are directly analogous and are therefore used as the intervention and comparison arms. Patients who failed 12-hour laboratory stop criteria were not retained in the abbreviated arm analysis and are not included in the PICO comparison.",
  "CLINICALQUESTION": "In low-risk patients with single or staggered acetaminophen overdose treated with IV NAC, does an abbreviated 12-hour 250 mg/kg regimen with early cessation when 12-hour labs are reassuring provide similar protection against hepatic injury compared with continuing the standard 20-hour 300 mg/kg regimen?",
  "CLINICALQUESTION_simple": "In low-risk acetaminophen overdose patients, is a shorter IV NAC regimen as effective as the standard longer regimen for preventing liver injury?",
  "BOTTOMLINE": "In carefully selected low-risk acetaminophen overdose patients, stopping a two-bag IV NAC infusion after an abbreviated 12-hour, 250 mg/kg course when serial labs remained normal resulted in no hepatic injury or hepatotoxicity, performing similarly to the standard 20-hour, 300 mg/kg regimen. These data support lab-guided early cessation of NAC in such low-risk patients, although the small, highly selected cohort and absence of events limit certainty and generalizability.",
  "BOTTOMLINE_simple": "In low-risk acetaminophen overdose patients, an abbreviated IV NAC course with early stopping based on reassuring labs appeared as safe as the standard longer course for liver outcomes.",

  ],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Traditional IV NAC regimens for acetaminophen overdose have used 20–21-hour, multi-bag infusions totaling 300 mg/kg, which effectively prevent hepatotoxicity but are complex, prone to dosing and infusion errors, associated with frequent adverse drug reactions, and prolong observation or hospital stay. Against this backdrop, NACSTOP asked whether a simplified two-bag regimen with lab-guided early cessation after 12 hours could safely shorten therapy in a rigorously defined low-risk population and found no liver injury or hepatotoxicity in either the shortened or standard regimen, supporting the feasibility of a stop-when-safe strategy.\n\nSubsequent practice recommendations, including the 2020 Australian and New Zealand paracetamol poisoning guideline, have adopted a simplified two-bag 20-hour NAC regimen as standard and cite NACSTOP and related work when discussing abbreviated or individualized treatment durations. Major North American and European guidance continues to recommend at least a 20–21-hour IV NAC course for most patients, with shortened or early-stop approaches such as the NACSTOP protocol generally reserved for carefully selected low-risk cases under toxicology input, while newer evidence from studies like SNAP and 2NAC has broadly supported simplified regimens but has not yet led to universal adoption of 12-hour early-stop protocols.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Small, single-country study with only 100 enrolled patients, providing limited statistical power to detect uncommon hepatic injury or hepatotoxicity events; Cluster-controlled, open-label design with allocation by site rather than individual randomization, introducing potential center-level confounding and selection differences between intervention and control hospitals; Study population was deliberately restricted to very low-risk patients and excluded massive overdoses, modified-release products, repeated supratherapeutic ingestions, pregnancy, and those with abnormal baseline or 12-hour labs, so results cannot be generalized to higher-risk acetaminophen poisoning; No hepatic injury or hepatotoxicity events occurred in either arm, preventing precise estimation of relative efficacy or formal noninferiority of the abbreviated regimen; Primary endpoints were based on short-term laboratory markers at 20 hours with only brief clinical follow-up, which may not fully capture rare or delayed liver complications, although such events were unlikely in this highly selected cohort."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Prior to this trial, routine chest radiography and sputum cytology had not demonstrated a clear reduction in lung cancer mortality, and the role of imaging-based screening in high-risk smokers was uncertain. The National Lung Screening Trial showed that serial low-dose CT screening in carefully selected heavy smokers could significantly reduce lung cancer–specific mortality compared with chest radiography, firmly establishing low-dose CT as an effective screening modality and shifting the focus from simple detection to mortality benefit.\nCurrent lung cancer screening guidelines from major societies, including USPSTF, NCCN, ACCP, and other national bodies, explicitly base their recommendations for annual low-dose CT screening of high-risk smokers on the NLST findings, with later trials such as NELSON largely reinforcing the mortality benefit and refining risk stratification. Contemporary guidelines have expanded and adjusted age and pack-year thresholds and emphasize shared decision-making, recognition of false positives, and structured nodule management, but they continue to endorse annual low-dose CT for appropriately selected high-risk individuals, reflecting durable acceptance of the NLST conclusions.",

  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "The trial had two screening strategies: three annual rounds of low-dose helical CT versus three annual single-view posteroanterior chest radiographs. For PICO framing and outcome extraction, the low-dose CT arm was selected as the intervention and the chest radiography arm as the comparator, as this is the primary comparison on which the trial’s main conclusions and mortality outcomes are based."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "For many years, mild asthma in adults was commonly managed with as-needed SABA alone, with or without optional low-dose ICS maintenance. Accumulating data from earlier trials (including SYGMA 1 and 2) suggested that as-needed budesonide–formoterol could prevent severe exacerbations at least as well as maintenance ICS plus SABA, but those studies used double-blind, double-dummy designs that did not fully reflect real-world SABA-dominant practice. Novel START addressed this gap with a pragmatic, open-label, multicenter trial in adults with mild asthma who had been using only SABA, directly comparing as-needed budesonide–formoterol to traditional SABA-only reliever therapy, and showed that the anti-inflammatory reliever strategy markedly reduced overall and severe exacerbations while limiting steroid exposure.\n\nThese findings, together with SYGMA and the PRACTICAL trial, were pivotal in the 2019 and subsequent GINA reports, which moved away from SABA-only treatment and now recommend low-dose ICS–formoterol as the preferred reliever for adults and adolescents at Steps 1–2 and as a reliever option across higher steps. Current GINA guidance continues to endorse this ICS–formoterol reliever approach, whereas the 2020 NHLBI asthma focused updates in the United States took a more conservative stance, emphasizing intermittent ICS taken with SABA and SMART (ICS–formoterol) mainly for moderate-to-severe asthma rather than universally in mild disease. Subsequent systematic reviews and meta-analyses pooling Novel START with other trials have confirmed that as-needed ICS–formoterol reduces severe exacerbations compared with SABA-only strategies with similar symptom control and no new safety concerns, so the core conclusions of Novel START remain aligned with contemporary guideline-based management of mild adult asthma.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age 18–75, doctor-diagnosed asthma, SABA as sole asthma therapy in prior 3 months, SABA use on ≥2 occasions in prior 4 weeks but on average ≤2 occasions per day, able and willing to comply with trial and give informed consent",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label, nonblinded design with no masking of patients or outcome assessors, introducing potential performance and detection bias; baseline imbalance in important prognostic factors, including a higher number of prior severe exacerbations in the as-needed SABA group compared with the budesonide–formoterol group, which could exaggerate the apparent benefit of the intervention; inclusion of some patients with a history of severe exacerbations who were still managed with SABA-only therapy at baseline, raising questions about the representativeness and appropriateness of pre-enrollment care; reliance on participant self-report and pragmatic definitions for exacerbation components (urgent visits, systemic steroid courses), which may introduce misclassification despite electronic monitoring of inhaler use; trial population limited to adults with mild asthma from a restricted set of countries, so results may not directly generalize to children, older patients with significant comorbidities, or those with more severe asthma; industry funding by the manufacturer of budesonide–formoterol, which, although common in drug trials, is a potential source of bias despite independent academic leadership and oversight",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "Novel START randomized adults with mild asthma to three arms: (1) as-needed albuterol alone, (2) maintenance budesonide twice daily plus as-needed albuterol, and (3) as-needed budesonide–formoterol. For this summary, the as-needed budesonide–formoterol arm is treated as the intervention and the as-needed albuterol-alone arm as the comparison, because this contrast directly addresses the key clinical question of whether an anti-inflammatory ICS–LABA reliever strategy is superior to traditional SABA-only reliever therapy in mild asthma; outcomes involving the maintenance budesonide arm are not used for the primary PICO-based comparisons."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Prior to this study, HFOV was considered a potentially superior lung-protective strategy for ARDS based on physiological rationale and small trials that used less rigorous control ventilation strategies, leading some centers to adopt HFOV early in the ARDS course or as a semi-routine modality. OSCILLATE, together with a contemporaneous neutral trial, demonstrated that when compared against a modern, protocolized low–tidal-volume, high-PEEP strategy with recruitment maneuvers, early HFOV not only failed to improve outcomes but was associated with higher mortality and greater need for sedation, paralysis, and vasoactive support, prompting rapid de-adoption of HFOV as standard first-line ventilation in adults with ARDS.\n\nSubsequent guideline statements on ARDS and mechanical ventilation from major societies, including recent critical care and ARDS management guidelines, have emphasized low–tidal-volume ventilation, appropriate PEEP titration, prone positioning, and conservative fluid strategies as core therapies, and do not recommend routine HFOV as first-line management in adult ARDS. HFOV is generally mentioned, if at all, as a possible rescue option in highly selected cases of refractory hypoxemia rather than a standard strategy, and newer evidence and practice patterns have reinforced OSCILLATE’s conclusion that HFOV offers no survival advantage over optimized conventional ventilation and may be harmful when used broadly.",

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "For decades, management of adult osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infection was anchored in dogma that 4–6 weeks of parenteral antibiotics were essential, based largely on observational data and expert opinion rather than randomized trials. OVIVA provided the first large-scale, pragmatic noninferiority RCT across the spectrum of complex bone and joint infections, showing that an early switch to high-bioavailability oral agents was as effective as prolonged IV therapy while reducing catheter-related complications and hospital stay; this has substantially shifted practice in many centers toward earlier oral step-down and more selective use of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy.\n\nMajor bone and joint infection guidelines, such as the 2012 IDSA prosthetic joint infection guideline and the 2015 IDSA native vertebral osteomyelitis guideline, largely predate OVIVA and emphasize prolonged IV therapy, while acknowledging that some agents with excellent oral bioavailability can be used as step-down therapy. Subsequent stewardship-focused guidance, including NICE antimicrobial prescribing recommendations for osteomyelitis and other infections, increasingly endorses oral therapy or early IV-to-oral switch when patients are clinically stable and suitable oral options exist, aligning with OVIVA’s conclusions. Newer observational and implementation studies and economic analyses have generally confirmed similar infection outcomes and reduced costs with OVIVA-style oral strategies, and no randomized data have emerged to contradict the trial, although guidelines still stress individualized decisions based on pathogen susceptibility, oral bioavailability, GI absorption, and patient reliability.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design with no placebo control introduces potential performance and ascertainment bias, although blinded endpoint adjudication was used; Heterogeneous population encompassing multiple infection types, pathogens, and surgical strategies may mask differences in specific subgroups and limits conclusions for any single clinical scenario; Antibiotic agents, combinations, and total durations were not standardized and were chosen by treating clinicians, so outcomes reflect treatment strategies rather than specific regimens and introduce potential confounding; The noninferiority margin was relaxed from 5% to 7.5% mid-trial after higher-than-expected failure rates, a change some commentators view as relatively generous and potentially more tolerant of worse outcomes with oral therapy; Crossovers and early discontinuation of assigned strategies, particularly from IV to oral because of line problems and from oral to IV because of concerns about recurrence, dilute differences between groups and complicate interpretation; Conducted entirely in U.K. centers with strong infectious-disease support and OPAT infrastructure, so generalizability to settings with limited access to close follow-up, to patients with poor enteral absorption, or to infections lacking active oral options is uncertain; Follow-up was limited to 1 year, so very late relapses or long-term functional differences may not have been fully captured."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before PARADIGM-HF, ACE inhibitors plus beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid antagonists formed the cornerstone of HFrEF therapy, with ARBs reserved mainly for ACEi-intolerant patients. Prior attempts to enhance natriuretic peptide signaling with combined ACE and neprilysin inhibition (e.g., omapatrilat) showed potential efficacy but were limited by excess angioedema. PARADIGM-HF tested a different strategy by pairing neprilysin inhibition (sacubitril) with ARB therapy (valsartan) and demonstrated clear advantages over well-established ACEi therapy in reducing CV death and HF hospitalization, leading to early trial termination for benefit and rapidly shifting clinical practice toward ARNI-based regimens in eligible HFrEF patients.\n\nSubsequent data and multiple guideline updates have incorporated PARADIGM-HF findings. The 2021 ESC HF guidelines and the 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA HF guideline recommend angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors as foundational, often preferred first-line renin–angiotensin system inhibition for symptomatic HFrEF, alongside evidence-based beta-blockers, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors. Later trials and real-world data have generally confirmed the benefits and safety profile of sacubitril/valsartan in HFrEF, although questions remain about its role in patients with advanced disease, low blood pressure, severe CKD, or those not resembling the relatively stable, run-in–selected PARADIGM-HF cohort.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Single-blind run-in phase required tolerance of both enalapril and full-dose sacubitril/valsartan, excluding a substantial fraction of screened patients and limiting generalizability to less stable or more fragile HFrEF populations; Early stopping for benefit may have led to overestimation of the magnitude of treatment effect, particularly for mortality outcomes; Comparison used a high valsartan dose (through the ARNI) versus a fixed enalapril dose, raising questions about whether benefit reflects ARNI effects per se versus more intensive renin–angiotensin blockade and greater blood pressure reduction; Patients with low SBP, advanced CKD, or recent decompensation were largely excluded, so safety and efficacy in these higher-risk groups remain less certain; Underrepresentation of NYHA class IV and very elderly or highly comorbid patients limits applicability to advanced HF and frail real-world populations; Some commentators have argued that the complex run-in design and unequal BP effects complicate interpretation and may bias in favor of sacubitril/valsartan",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "PARADIGM-HF randomized patients to only two double-blind arms—LCZ696 (sacubitril/valsartan) 200 mg BID versus enalapril 10 mg BID—so these were directly selected as the intervention and comparator without need to collapse or choose among multiple treatment arms."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Systemic thrombolysis was well established for high-risk (massive) PE but its role in intermediate-risk (submassive) PE—patients who are normotensive yet have RV dysfunction and myocardial injury—was controversial due to concerns about bleeding and uncertain mortality benefit. PEITHO, the largest randomized trial in this population, clarified that full-dose systemic tenecteplase reduces early hemodynamic deterioration but substantially increases major bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke without improving short-term mortality, moderating enthusiasm for routine systemic lysis in submassive PE and shifting practice toward more selective use.\nCurrent guidelines such as the ESC 2019/2020 acute PE guidelines, as well as contemporaneous ACCP/CHEST and ACC expert consensus documents, incorporate PEITHO’s findings by advising against routine systemic thrombolysis in intermediate-risk PE and reserving it for patients with evidence of clinical deterioration or very high risk and low bleeding risk, often favoring catheter-directed options or escalation only if decompensation occurs. Subsequent trials and long-term follow-up of PEITHO participants have confirmed a lack of durable mortality or functional benefit from full-dose systemic thrombolysis in this group, reinforcing a conservative, individualized approach rather than routine lytic therapy.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Composite primary outcome combined death with hemodynamic decompensation, which have different clinical importance and may respond differently to therapy; Trial was not powered to detect differences in mortality, limiting conclusions about survival benefit; Inclusion window up to 15 days from symptom onset may have attenuated potential benefits of thrombolysis and increased bleeding risk in some patients; Marked increase in major bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke, particularly in older patients, raises concerns about net clinical benefit and limits generalizability to high-bleeding-risk populations; Full-dose systemic tenecteplase was used, leaving uncertainty about whether lower-dose systemic or catheter-directed regimens might provide a better risk–benefit profile; Some critiques note that the modest absolute reduction in hemodynamic decompensation may not justify the substantially increased risk of major hemorrhage when applied broadly to all intermediate-risk PE patients"

Current AHA/ASA secondary stroke prevention guidelines and European Stroke Organisation recommendations therefore endorse short-term dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (typically about 21 days, up to 90 days in selected patients) after minor non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA, followed by single antiplatelet therapy, and later trials with ticagrelor-based regimens have expanded options, but POINT remains a foundational study underpinning guideline-level recommendations for early DAPT in this population.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "The trial was stopped early after enrollment of about 84% of the planned sample, which can overestimate treatment effects and reduced power for some secondary and subgroup analyses; Dual antiplatelet therapy was continued for 90 days even though subsequent time-course and pooled analyses showed that most net benefit occurs during the first 2–3 weeks, so the regimen studied likely overstates bleeding risk relative to the shorter durations now recommended; Absolute risk reductions in major ischemic events and absolute increases in major hemorrhage were modest, and the relatively small number of major bleeds limited the precision of safety estimates and the ability to identify bleeding risk factors; Patients eligible for thrombolysis, endovascular therapy, or carotid surgery, those with more than minor stroke severity, and those with low-risk TIA were excluded, which limits generalizability to broader stroke and TIA populations; All participants were required to tolerate aspirin and have no clear indication for anticoagulation, so results do not apply to patients who cannot take aspirin or who need therapeutic anticoagulation for conditions such as atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves."

PRECISION was designed to clarify whether moder­ate-dose celecoxib increases major cardiovascular events compared with commonly used nonselective NSAIDs (naproxen and ibuprofen) in patients with arthritis and elevated cardiovascular risk, and it challenged the prior assumption that naproxen is uniquely cardioprotective among NSAIDs.\n\nSubsequent guidelines for OA management, such as the 2019 American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation guideline, continue to recommend oral NSAIDs (including celecoxib and nonselective agents) as core pharmacologic therapy but emphasize using the lowest effective dose and accounting for GI, renal, and cardiovascular risk. Multidisciplinary NSAID safety recommendations for patients with cardiovascular and other comorbidities advise avoiding NSAIDs in very high cardiovascular-risk patients when possible, but when a chronic NSAID is unavoidable, naproxen or celecoxib are generally preferred, consistent with the overall safety profile observed in PRECISION; later observational data and substudies largely support comparable or slightly more favorable cardiorenal and GI safety with celecoxib at moderate doses, while reinforcing that all NSAIDs should be used cautiously in patients with established CVD.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "High discontinuation and low retention, with nearly 70% of participants stopping the study drug and more than a quarter discontinuing follow-up, which may dilute or bias detection of safety signals; Majority of enrolled patients had OA and were in a primary prevention category with relatively low absolute cardiovascular event rates, limiting power to detect modest differences among drugs in higher-risk secondary prevention populations; Celecoxib was studied at moderate doses below the maximum approved dose, so results may not extrapolate to higher doses, shorter-acting regimens, or intermittent over-the-counter use; The trial compared only celecoxib, ibuprofen, and naproxen and lacked a placebo or no-NSAID control, so it cannot quantify the absolute increase in cardiovascular risk from NSAID therapy versus nonuse; Potential differences in low-dose aspirin coadministration and aspirin–NSAID pharmacodynamic interactions were not fully characterized and may have biased results in favor of celecoxib.",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "The trial randomized patients to celecoxib, naproxen, or ibuprofen, with co-primary noninferiority comparisons of celecoxib versus each nonselective NSAID. For this summary, celecoxib was chosen as the intervention and naproxen as the comparator because naproxen has often been considered a reference nonselective NSAID for cardiovascular safety and was a prespecified primary comparator in the trial."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "For decades, the standard preventive therapy for latent TB infection in low-incidence settings was 6–9 months of daily isoniazid, which is effective but limited by poor treatment completion and risk of hepatotoxicity. The PREVENT TB trial provided pivotal evidence that a shorter 3‑month regimen of once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP), given by directly observed therapy, could maintain noninferior protection against progression to active TB while improving adherence and reducing hepatotoxicity compared with 9 months of daily isoniazid. This shifted thinking toward rifamycin-based, shorter-course preventive regimens as a practical strategy for TB elimination efforts.\n\nSubsequent studies and guideline updates have reinforced and expanded the role of 3HP. U.S. guidelines from the CDC, American Thoracic Society, and Infectious Diseases Society of America, as well as later CDC-specific latent TB infection treatment recommendations, endorse rifapentine–isoniazid 3HP as a preferred regimen for most adults and adolescents without contraindications, and allow for both directly observed and self-administered therapy in appropriate populations. Global guidance, including WHO TB preventive treatment recommendations, recognizes rifamycin-based short-course regimens (such as 3HP and 4 months of rifampin) as effective alternatives to longer isoniazid monotherapy, and subsequent trials in people living with HIV and in children have generally confirmed the efficacy and tolerability of 3HP. However, widespread implementation remains influenced by rifapentine cost and availability, local programmatic capacity, and management of drug–drug interactions with ART and other therapies.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥12 years, latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, high risk for progression to active TB (e.g., recent close contact with a culture-confirmed pulmonary TB case or recent tuberculin skin test conversion, or other clinical risk factors), residence in participating sites in the United States, Canada, Brazil, or Spain, ability to adhere to study visits and procedures",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design without blinding may have influenced reporting of subjective adverse events and adherence behaviors; The intervention arm received directly observed therapy whereas the control arm was self-administered, introducing differences in adherence support that may have favored higher completion in the rifapentine–isoniazid group beyond regimen duration alone; Only a small proportion of participants were HIV-infected and those on antiretroviral therapy were excluded, limiting applicability to many people living with HIV and complicating extrapolation to populations with complex drug–drug interactions; Most participants were from low-incidence, high-resource settings in North America, so generalizability to high-burden, low-resource settings is uncertain; Rifapentine cost, availability, and programmatic requirements for directly observed dosing were not addressed and may limit real-world implementation despite favorable efficacy and safety; The noninferiority margin selection and relatively low event rate mean that small differences in TB risk between regimens cannot be fully excluded; Long-term safety beyond the 33‑month follow-up and potential rare adverse events or resistance patterns were not fully characterized."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this trial, the PERC rule had been validated mainly in observational cohorts and was used by many emergency physicians to avoid unnecessary testing for PE in very low-risk patients, but it lacked randomized trial evidence and had shown conflicting safety results in some European studies. PROPER provided the first randomized, multicenter evaluation of a PERC-based strategy versus a conventional D-dimer/CTPA pathway, demonstrating that in carefully selected low-gestalt-risk patients, a PERC-based approach could safely reduce imaging and admissions without increasing clinically important missed thromboembolic events.\n\nSubsequent guideline documents have incorporated these findings variably: the 2018 American College of Emergency Physicians acute venous thromboembolic disease clinical policy explicitly recommends use of PERC for low-risk suspected PE, whereas the 2019 ESC/ERS PE guideline describes PERC as an option to reduce overtesting but notes that the low PE prevalence and highly selected populations in validation studies and PROPER limit generalizability. More recent observational studies and diagnostic algorithms (such as age-adjusted D-dimer, YEARS, and other structured pathways) have complemented rather than replaced PERC, and current practice generally supports PERC use only in very low-risk, hemodynamically stable ED patients after clinical gestalt assessment.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Underlying PE prevalence in the low-gestalt population was very low, limiting power and precision to detect small differences in missed events; Study conducted in French EDs with relatively young patients, which may limit generalizability to older or higher-risk populations and to settings with higher PE prevalence; Cluster crossover design at the ED level introduces potential period and center effects despite adjustment; Protocol deviations occurred in both arms (some PERC-negative patients still underwent D-dimer or imaging, and some control patients did not have D-dimer), potentially diluting between-group differences; Outcome assessment relied on 3-month follow-up via phone, records, and administrative data with a small proportion lost to follow-up, so asymptomatic or unrecognized events could have been missed; CTPA was considered positive even for isolated subsegmental PE, which may overestimate clinically important PE and complicate interpretation of missed events; Later guideline commentary has highlighted that the very low PE prevalence in PROPER and earlier PERC validation studies may limit the applicability of a PERC-only strategy outside similarly low-risk environments."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this trial, support for damage control resuscitation and high plasma and platelet ratios in massive transfusion came largely from retrospective and observational studies, which suggested improved early survival with more balanced component therapy approximating whole blood. PROPPR was the first large multicenter randomized trial to directly compare two fixed component ratios in severely bleeding trauma patients, showing no significant difference in overall 24-h or 30-d mortality but a clear reduction in exsanguination deaths and improved achievement of hemostasis with 1:1:1, without excess inflammatory or thrombotic complications. These findings helped shift practice from crystalloid-heavy, RBC-first resuscitation toward early, balanced component therapy for patients with life-threatening traumatic hemorrhage.\n\nSubsequent trauma resuscitation guidelines have incorporated PROPPR as foundational evidence. Early American College of Surgeons trauma quality guidelines permitted initial ratios between 1:1:2 and 1:1:1, while later guidance from EAST and European trauma bleeding guidelines recommended balanced transfusion approximating whole blood, often explicitly favoring 1:1:1 or at least 1:1:2 as the starting point for massive transfusion. Recent ACS and American Association for the Surgery of Trauma recommendations endorse massive transfusion protocols providing rapid, balanced blood product resuscitation (commonly 1:1:1 components or whole blood), with adjunctive use of tranexamic acid and viscoelastic-guided therapy. Newer data on whole blood and goal-directed coagulation management have refined but not overturned PROPPR’s core conclusion that early, balanced component resuscitation is safe and improves hemorrhage control, and 1:1:1 remains an accepted default strategy where whole blood or fully goal-directed approaches are not immediately available.",
  "INCLUSION": "Highest-level trauma activation, age ≥15 y or weight ≥50 kg if age unknown, received directly from the injury scene, transfusion of ≥1 U of any blood component started prehospital or within 1 h of arrival, predicted massive transfusion need (Assessment of Blood Consumption score ≥2 or attending judgment of ≥10 U RBCs in 24 h)",
  "EXCLUSION": "Received lifesaving intervention at an outside hospital, devastating injuries expected to cause death within 1 h (for example lethal TBI), admission directly from a correctional facility, thoracotomy required before randomized blood products in the ED, age <15 y or weight <50 kg if age unknown, known pregnancy, burns >20% total body surface area, suspected inhalation injury, >5 min of CPR with chest compressions before or in the ED, preexisting do-not-resuscitate order, enrollment in another interventional randomized trial, prior opt-out from the study, >3 U RBCs given before randomization",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Powered only to detect relatively large mortality differences (10% at 24 h, 12% at 30 d), so the observed smaller absolute mortality differences may have been underpowered to reach statistical significance; Observed mortality in the 1:1:2 comparison group was lower than anticipated, further reducing effective power and requiring an estimated much larger sample to detect the 4.2% absolute 24-h mortality difference; The trial compared only two fixed component ratios and could not isolate the independent effects of plasma vs platelets on outcomes; Patients could receive up to 3 U RBCs before randomization, so the randomized ratios were not applied from the very first transfused unit; Open-label management after opening the first container and subsequent laboratory-guided transfusions in both arms allowed the 1:1:2 group to “catch up” toward a 1:1:1 ratio over 24 h, likely attenuating between-group differences in mortality and secondary outcomes; Inability to fully exclude patients with unsurvivable traumatic brain injury and the competing risks of hemorrhagic vs neurologic death complicate interpretation of mortality end points; Conducted at high-volume North American level I trauma centers with rapid access to thawed plasma, platelets, and extensive blood bank support, which may limit generalizability to lower-resource or non-trauma-center settings."

  "INTERVENTION": "Early, prolonged prone positioning plus lung-protective ventilation",
  "INTERVENTION_DETAILS": "Patients randomized to the intervention were placed in the prone position for at least 16 consecutive hours per day, starting early after randomization following a 12–24 hour stabilization period, and continued with daily prone sessions for up to 28 days or until predefined oxygenation criteria were met. Between prone sessions, patients were returned to supine. Mechanical ventilation in both groups followed a lung-protective, volume-controlled strategy with tidal volume ≈6 mL/kg predicted body weight, plateau pressure target ≤30 cm H2O, PEEP set according to standardized protocols, and FiO2 adjusted to maintain adequate oxygenation. Sedation, neuromuscular blockade (often used early), weaning, and hemodynamic management were protocolized similarly in both arms, and all participating ICUs had several years of experience with this proning protocol.",
  "COMPARISON": "Standard semi-recumbent supine positioning plus lung-protective ventilation",
  "COMPARISON_DETAILS": "Patients randomized to the control group were maintained in a standard semi-recumbent supine position throughout their ICU course, receiving the same lung-protective, volume-controlled ventilation strategy with tidal volume ≈6 mL/kg predicted body weight, plateau pressure target ≤30 cm H2O, and PEEP/FiO2 titration per protocol. Sedation, neuromuscular blockade, weaning criteria, and other co-interventions followed the same standardized protocols as in the prone group, but patients were not routinely proned.",
  "OUTCOME": "28-day all-cause mortality",
  "OUTCOME_DETAILS": "The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at day 28 after inclusion. Key secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality at day 90, ventilator-free days by day 28 or 90, ICU and hospital length of stay, and safety outcomes including complications of prone positioning such as accidental extubation, endotracheal tube obstruction, pressure sores, pneumothorax, unplanned removal of intravascular catheters, and cardiac arrest. The trial showed substantially lower 28-day and 90-day mortality in the prone group without an overall increase in serious complications, aside from a higher incidence of cardiac arrest in the supine group.",

  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "The trial compared two prespecified strategies: early, prolonged prone positioning versus standard semi-recumbent supine positioning, each combined with the same lung-protective ventilation protocol. These are the only two arms in the study, so the prone positioning arm was selected as the intervention and the semi-recumbent supine arm as the sole comparator.",

  ],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this trial, multiple randomized studies of prone positioning in ARDS had consistently shown improved oxygenation but failed to demonstrate a clear survival benefit, in part because they included mixed severities of ARDS, shorter proning sessions, and heterogeneous ventilator strategies. PROSEVA focused on a highly selected population with severe ARDS, mandated lung-protective ventilation, applied early and prolonged daily proning, and demonstrated a large and consistent mortality reduction, which transformed proning from a rescue maneuver for refractory hypoxemia into a core disease-modifying therapy in severe ARDS.\n\nSubsequent evidence and major guidelines in ARDS management, including international ARDS management guidelines and critical care society recommendations as well as sepsis and COVID-19 ventilation guidance, explicitly endorse early, prolonged prone positioning (typically ≥16 hours per day) for adults with moderate-to-severe or severe ARDS meeting PROSEVA-like hypoxemia criteria despite optimal lung-protective ventilation. Later meta-analyses and observational data in both non–COVID and COVID-related ARDS generally confirm a survival benefit when proning is used early, for long sessions, and in centers with adequate expertise. Current guidelines do not recommend routine proning for mild ARDS or outside the context of established criteria, and awake non-intubated proning is treated as a separate, evolving practice that does not alter the core conclusions of PROSEVA for invasively ventilated severe ARDS.",
  "INCLUSION": "Adult patients with severe ARDS, PaO2:FiO2 <150 mm Hg on FiO2 ≥0.6 with PEEP ≥5 cm H2O and tidal volume ≈6 mL/kg predicted body weight, intubated and mechanically ventilated <36 hours at inclusion, severe ARDS criteria confirmed after 12–24 hours of stabilization under lung-protective ventilation",
  "EXCLUSION": "Contraindications to prone positioning (such as unstable spine, facial trauma, recent tracheal or neurosurgery, or elevated intracranial pressure), morbid obesity, pregnancy, decision to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment, substantial clinical improvement during the 12–24 hour stabilization period such that severe ARDS criteria were no longer met",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design with inevitable lack of blinding of treating clinicians, which could introduce bias in co-interventions and supportive care; Conducted exclusively in ICUs with extensive prior experience and structured protocols for prone positioning, which may limit generalizability to less experienced centers; Trial was stopped early at an interim analysis for benefit, raising the possibility that treatment effects may be overestimated compared with a fully completed study; Large proportion of screened ARDS patients were excluded, focusing on a narrow subgroup with very severe hypoxemia and short prior ventilation duration, which may limit applicability to broader ARDS populations; Baseline imbalances such as higher illness severity scores, vasopressor use, and neuromuscular blocker use in the prone group might confound the observed effect despite randomization; The complex bundle of care (lung-protective ventilation, deep sedation, neuromuscular blockade, conservative fluid strategies) intertwined with proning makes it difficult to attribute all of the mortality benefit solely to prone positioning itself; Safety outcomes were relatively infrequent and the study may have been underpowered to detect differences in less common but clinically important complications of proning, such as severe pressure injuries or accidental extubation in lower-volume centers."

  "INTERVENTION": "Protocol-based early resuscitation (combined EGDT or protocol-based standard therapy) for the first 6 hours.",
  "INTERVENTION_DETAILS": "Patients assigned to protocol-based care received 6 hours of structured resuscitation directed by a dedicated team using written algorithms. In the protocol-based EGDT arm, care followed a Rivers-style EGDT protocol: placement of a central venous catheter with continuous monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2); administration of IV crystalloid boluses targeting CVP 8–12 mm Hg; vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥65 mm Hg; transfusion of packed RBCs to achieve a hematocrit around 30% and/or dobutamine infusion to achieve ScvO2 ≥70% when hypotension and low ScvO2 persisted despite fluids. In the protocol-based standard-therapy arm, a simplified algorithm guided fluids and vasopressors over 6 hours (with central venous access and CVP monitoring encouraged) but did not require ScvO2 monitoring or mandate inotropes or blood transfusion; both protocol arms emphasized early broad-spectrum antibiotics and rapid fluid resuscitation, with post–6-hour management left to treating clinicians.",

  "SECONDARYOUTCOMES": [],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) as popularized by the Rivers trial led to widespread adoption of rigid, CVP- and ScvO2-guided resuscitation bundles for septic shock, and early Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines strongly endorsed this approach. ProCESS was designed to test whether these protocolized hemodynamic targets remained necessary in an era when ED and ICU teams were already delivering earlier antibiotics, rapid IV fluids, and improved critical care; the neutral results, together with ARISE and ProMISe, showed that adding a complex EGDT-style protocol and mandatory invasive monitoring did not further improve mortality compared with high-quality usual care.\n\nSubsequent guidelines, including Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2016 and 2021 and Sepsis-3-based recommendations, have incorporated ProCESS and the related EGDT “trilogy” by de-emphasizing CVP and ScvO2 targets and no longer recommending routine EGDT-style protocols. Current guidance focuses instead on rapid recognition, timely broad-spectrum antibiotics, early adequate crystalloid (often around 30 mL/kg), vasopressors to maintain MAP ≥65 mm Hg, and dynamic assessment of perfusion (often lactate-guided), while not mandating EGDT-type invasive hemodynamic protocols; no major contemporary guideline recommends routine protocolized EGDT for all patients with septic shock.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design with potential for performance bias; substantial overlap between protocol-based strategies and increasingly aggressive usual care, leading to contamination and reduced between-group differences; lower-than-expected mortality in all arms and mid-trial adjustment of sample size, reducing power to detect modest benefits; conducted in US academic EDs with strong sepsis processes, limiting generalizability to resource-limited or less protocolized settings; not powered to detect treatment effects in important subgroups (e.g., very high lactate, profound shock); protocol adherence in intervention arms was high but not perfect, potentially diluting treatment contrast; exclusion of patients with major comorbid conditions or limitations of care may limit applicability to some high-risk real-world populations."

Vasopressors were titrated to maintain MAP >65 mm Hg and/or SBP >90 mm Hg. Once CVP and MAP goals were achieved, ScvO2 was targeted >70%: if ScvO2 <70% and hemoglobin <100 g/L, packed red cells were transfused; if ScvO2 <70% and hemoglobin ≥100 g/L, dobutamine was started at 2.5–20 mcg/kg/min and titrated; if ScvO2 remained <70%, escalation of oxygen therapy, noninvasive ventilation, and mechanical ventilation with sedation and paralysis as needed were used.

Current Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 guidelines emphasize immediate recognition, timely antimicrobials, an initial 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus, MAP targets around 65 mm Hg, dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness, and individualized vasopressor and inotrope use, and they no longer recommend routine Rivers-style EGDT with mandatory CVP and ScvO2 targets; subsequent meta-analyses have reinforced that such EGDT protocols offer no outcome advantage over high-quality usual care.",

Key secondary outcomes included recurrence of AF within 4 weeks (by telemetric monitoring and ECG), time to first AF recurrence, duration of the index ED visit, recurrent ED visits for AF, cardiovascular complications (including heart failure, stroke/TIA, ACS, and rate- or blood pressure–related events) within 4 weeks, and AF-specific quality of life measured by the AFEQT questionnaire.",

Most patients in the wait-and-see group converted spontaneously, cardioversion use and ED time were reduced, and short-term cardiovascular complication rates were similarly low between strategies.",

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Acute management of AF in the ED has traditionally emphasized prompt restoration of sinus rhythm within 48 hours, often via immediate pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, based largely on concerns about symptoms, hemodynamics, and thromboembolic risk. Observational data, however, have long shown that many episodes of recent-onset AF convert spontaneously, raising the possibility that routine immediate cardioversion may lead to unnecessary procedures, longer ED stays, and higher resource use. RACE 7 ACWAS tested a structured wait-and-see strategy with rate control and selective delayed cardioversion against standard early cardioversion and demonstrated that, in carefully selected hemodynamically stable patients with AF of <36 hours, delayed cardioversion achieves similar short-term rhythm control while allowing the majority of patients to convert without any cardioversion.\n\nSubsequent practice patterns and guidelines have incorporated these findings by acknowledging that, for stable patients with AF of clearly <48 hours’ duration, both immediate cardioversion and a rate-control wait-and-see strategy are reasonable options, provided appropriate anticoagulation is used according to CHA2DS2-VASc and close follow-up is available. The 2020 ESC AF guidelines explicitly recognize delayed cardioversion as an acceptable approach in selected recent-onset AF, and newer guidance such as the 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS AF guideline highlights that many hemodynamically stable AF episodes can be managed initially with rate control and outpatient follow-up rather than urgent cardioversion. At the same time, emerging data that thromboembolic risk is not uniformly low even when AF appears to be <48 hours have pushed guidelines toward more consistent use of pericardioversion and post-cardioversion anticoagulation, especially when CHA2DS2-VASc ≥2. Overall, later evidence and expert reviews have broadly confirmed the main clinical message of RACE 7 ACWAS—wait-and-see is safe and effective in selected low- to intermediate-risk patients—but emphasize careful patient selection, robust outpatient infrastructure, and continued attention to stroke prevention.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age >18 years, symptomatic atrial fibrillation with symptom duration <36 hours, AF documented on ECG, heart rate >70 bpm, hemodynamically stable, symptoms judged primarily due to AF, able and willing to use a handheld telemetric rhythm recorder, presentation to the ED of a participating hospital in the Netherlands",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design without blinding, which may influence clinician behavior and some subjective outcomes; Noninferiority margin of −10 percentage points for sinus rhythm at 4 weeks may be considered relatively wide from a clinical perspective; Short follow-up of only 4 weeks limits assessment of longer-term rhythm control, stroke risk, and health-care utilization; Trial was not powered to detect differences in uncommon but critical safety outcomes such as stroke, systemic embolism, or death; Recurrent AF was monitored with intermittent handheld ECG recordings, likely underestimating true AF burden and asymptomatic episodes; Requirement for rapid 48-hour outpatient reassessment and access to cardioversion may limit generalizability to systems without strong outpatient infrastructure or cardiology follow-up; Study population excluded hemodynamically unstable patients, those with prior prolonged AF episodes, and certain higher-risk phenotypes, so results may not apply to sicker or more complex AF populations; Conducted entirely in Dutch centers with specific organization of ED and cardiology services, which may differ from workflows and resource constraints in other health systems"

  ],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this trial, prehospital management of status epilepticus commonly relied on IV benzodiazepines such as lorazepam, which were known to improve outcomes but were often delayed or technically difficult because of the need for IV access in seizing patients. Intramuscular midazolam offered theoretical advantages including faster and more reliable administration and better stability outside refrigeration, but high-quality comparative evidence was lacking. RAMPART provided definitive randomized data demonstrating that IM midazolam is at least as effective, and in practice somewhat superior, to IV lorazepam for early seizure termination without increasing serious adverse events, thereby supporting a paradigm shift toward IM treatment in the field.\n\nSubsequent guideline updates, including neurocritical care and emergency medicine guidance on status epilepticus, have incorporated these findings by listing midazolam (including IM administration) as a first-line benzodiazepine option for convulsive status epilepticus, particularly in the prehospital setting or when IV access is delayed or impractical. Later observational studies of real-world EMS practice have confirmed the effectiveness and safety of prehospital midazolam and documented increased national uptake after RAMPART, reinforcing the trial’s conclusions rather than contradicting them; current US and international recommendations generally consider IM midazolam an evidence-based and guideline-concordant option for initial benzodiazepine therapy in convulsive status epilepticus.",
  "INCLUSION": "Convulsive seizure activity >5 minutes (continuous or recurrent without regaining consciousness), still seizing at time of paramedic treatment, estimated weight ≥13 kg, transport to a participating hospital",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Because midazolam and lorazepam were compared only as IM versus IV, the design cannot distinguish whether superior seizure termination was due to the drug, the route, or both; Use of an autoinjector for IM administration may limit generalizability to settings using conventional IM injections without autoinjectors; The study was conducted in structured US EMS systems with specific protocols, so results may not fully generalize to regions with different prehospital resources or training; The trial was powered and designed as a noninferiority study, and although superiority was demonstrated for the primary outcome, it was not primarily designed to explore detailed subgroup effects; Long-term neurological and functional outcomes were not primary endpoints, so the impact of the treatment strategy on long-term disability and quality of life is less well characterized."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before RECOVERY, use of systemic corticosteroids in viral pneumonias, including SARS and influenza, was controversial due to concerns about delayed viral clearance and secondary infections, and early Covid-19 guidance tended to discourage routine steroid use. The RECOVERY dexamethasone comparison provided the first large, randomized evidence of a mortality benefit from any pharmacologic therapy in Covid-19, demonstrating clear benefit in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure while suggesting possible harm in non-hypoxic patients, and it rapidly shifted global practice toward targeted steroid use in severe and critical disease.\n\nSubsequent randomized trials and meta-analyses of systemic corticosteroids in severe and critical Covid-19 have largely confirmed RECOVERY’s core conclusion that low-dose dexamethasone (6 mg daily for up to 10 days) improves survival in patients requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support but not in those without hypoxemia. Current major guidelines, including the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines, IDSA COVID-19 guidelines, WHO living guidelines, and national guidance such as NICE rapid Covid-19 guidelines, recommend systemic corticosteroids—typically dexamethasone 6 mg IV or PO daily—for hospitalized adults with severe or critical Covid-19 who need supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, and recommend against their use in patients who do not require oxygen; newer data on higher-dose regimens and alternative steroids have refined dosing recommendations but have not overturned the central role of low-dose dexamethasone established by RECOVERY.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design without placebo or blinding, which could influence co-interventions and assessment of non-mortality outcomes; No stratification by center and limited reporting of center-level effects, raising the possibility of site-related confounding; Important baseline characteristics such as BMI, ethnicity, detailed comorbidity profiles, and ICU vs ward location at randomization were incompletely reported, limiting assessment of residual confounding and subgroup effects; For ventilated patients, key severity indicators such as PEEP, FiO2, and PaO2/FiO2 were not reported, constraining interpretation of benefit across ARDS severity; Only short-term (28-day) mortality and hospital outcomes were reported, with no long-term follow-up on functional status or late adverse effects; Age imbalance and incomplete reporting of prognostic factor distributions across treatment and respiratory-support subgroups complicate detailed subgroup interpretation; Safety outcomes such as secondary infections, metabolic complications, and neuromuscular weakness were not systematically characterized, so the full adverse-effect profile of dexamethasone in this setting remains uncertain; The trial was conducted early in the pandemic in UK hospitals before widespread use of other effective therapies (such as IL-6 inhibitors and later antivirals), so extrapolation of absolute effects to later waves and different treatment backbones requires caution"

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Patients with elevated TG remain at substantial residual ASCVD risk despite effective LDL-C lowering with statins, and prior attempts to target this risk with niacin, fibrates, mixed omega-3 formulations, and CETP inhibitors largely failed to improve outcomes. Earlier evidence from the JELIS trial suggested benefit of EPA in Japanese patients, but results were not definitive or widely generalizable. REDUCE-IT tested high-dose, highly purified EPA (icosapent ethyl) in a contemporary, largely secondary-prevention, statin-treated population with moderate hypertriglyceridemia and demonstrated a large, consistent reduction in major ischemic events, distinguishing EPA-only therapy from negative trials of lower-dose or mixed EPA/DHA products and helping to establish TG-rich lipoproteins and EPA-related mechanisms as important therapeutic targets beyond LDL-C.\n\nFollowing REDUCE-IT, multiple guidelines incorporated high-dose icosapent ethyl for residual risk reduction, including the 2019 ESC/EAS dyslipidaemia guidelines and their 2025 focused update, which recommend considering icosapent ethyl 2 g BID in high- or very high-risk patients with TG 135–499 mg/dL on statins, and the 2021 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on persistent hypertriglyceridemia, which highlights icosapent ethyl as the preferred triglyceride-directed therapy for ASCVD and high-risk diabetes patients with elevated TG on statins. Diabetes and lipid guidelines from major societies similarly endorse or consider icosapent ethyl in this setting. At the same time, concerns about the mineral-oil placebo and biomarker changes in the control arm, as well as neutral results with other omega-3 formulations, have fueled ongoing debate and calls for confirmatory studies, but current guidelines still rely heavily on REDUCE-IT as the foundational evidence supporting icosapent ethyl for cardiovascular risk reduction in high-risk, statin-treated patients with elevated TG.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥45 y with established CVD or ≥50 y with diabetes + ≥1 additional CV risk factor, fasting TG 135–499 mg/dL on enrollment, LDL-C 41–100 mg/dL, on stable statin therapy ≥4 weeks",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Use of a mineral-oil placebo, which was associated with increases in LDL-C and inflammatory markers in the placebo arm, has raised concerns that part of the apparent benefit may reflect harm from the comparator rather than benefit from icosapent ethyl, and this remains a subject of ongoing debate despite post hoc analyses suggesting limited clinical impact; The trial population was predominantly secondary-prevention, middle-aged, statin-treated patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia, so results may not generalize to lower-risk primary-prevention patients, those with very high TG, or individuals not on statins; Women and some racial and ethnic minority groups were underrepresented, limiting confidence in sex- and race-specific treatment effects; The study was sponsored by the manufacturer of icosapent ethyl, which collected and analyzed the data, raising the possibility of sponsor bias despite independent endpoint adjudication and data monitoring; Icosapent ethyl increased hospitalization for atrial fibrillation/flutter and showed a numerical excess of serious bleeding, so long-term safety, particularly regarding arrhythmia and bleeding risk, requires continued surveillance and further study."

This could occur during the index exacerbation (requiring open-label systemic glucocorticoids or intensified treatment while hospitalized) or during follow-up. Key secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, change in FEV1, cumulative systemic glucocorticoid dose, clinical performance (MRC dyspnea scale, bronchitis-associated quality-of-life score, and patient-reported overall performance), duration of hospital stay, time to and need for mechanical ventilation, time to open-label glucocorticoid therapy, and glucocorticoid-associated adverse effects such as new or worsening hyperglycemia, hypertension, infections, and other steroid-related events.",

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before REDUCE, international COPD guidelines typically recommended 7–14 days of systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations, based largely on limited evidence and expert consensus. REDUCE provided robust randomized, double-blind evidence that a 5-day course of 40 mg prednisone daily was noninferior to a 14-day course for preventing reexacerbations, with similar mortality, lung function recovery, and symptom outcomes but markedly lower cumulative steroid doses. This trial helped shift practice away from longer, higher-exposure steroid regimens toward shorter, standardized courses in hospitalized COPD exacerbations.\n\nSubsequent COPD management strategies, including GOLD 2014 and later updates, incorporated the REDUCE findings by recommending prednisone 40 mg daily for about 5 days for most acute exacerbations, and more recent iterations emphasize short courses (generally not exceeding 5–7 days) of systemic steroids. ERS/ATS guidance for ambulatory AE-COPD also supports short-course systemic corticosteroids. Later observational data and meta-analyses have generally confirmed that abbreviated steroid regimens achieve comparable clinical outcomes with reduced steroid burden, and current major guidelines continue to endorse short-course systemic corticosteroids informed in large part by the REDUCE trial, without contradicting evidence that longer standard courses improve outcomes.",

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this trial, decompressive craniectomy for severe TBI with raised ICP was widely used despite limited randomized evidence and conflicting data. The DECRA trial had suggested that early bifrontal craniectomy for moderate, earlier ICP elevations did not improve mortality and worsened functional outcomes, raising concerns about routine use. RESCUEicp specifically tested decompressive craniectomy as a last-tier intervention in patients with more severe, sustained refractory intracranial hypertension, demonstrating a substantial mortality reduction but at the cost of increased survival with vegetative state and severe disability. This reframed decompressive craniectomy as a therapy that trades mortality benefit for a higher burden of serious long-term disability and emphasized the need for individualized, values-based decisions with patients’ surrogates.\n\nInitial Brain Trauma Foundation severe TBI guidelines in 2016 recognized decompressive craniectomy but were finalized just before RESCUEicp results and explicitly anticipated that its findings might alter recommendations. A 2020 update of the decompressive craniectomy recommendations incorporated both DECRA and RESCUEicp, issuing level IIa guidance that secondary decompressive craniectomy for late refractory ICP elevation is recommended to improve mortality and overall outcomes, whereas early secondary decompression is not recommended for that purpose, and emphasizing the need for large frontotemporoparietal flaps. Subsequent 24‑month follow-up of RESCUEicp patients has confirmed a sustained mortality benefit with some continued functional improvement over time but persistent high rates of moderate-to-severe disability, so current guidelines generally support decompressive craniectomy as a salvage option for late refractory ICP, to be offered within multidisciplinary, shared decision-making frameworks rather than as routine early therapy.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age 10–65 years, traumatic brain injury with abnormal brain CT, intracranial pressure monitor in place, sustained ICP >25 mm Hg for 1–12 hours despite stage 1 and 2 ICP-directed therapies, eligible for secondary decompressive craniectomy or continued medical management at a center with 24-hour neurosurgical services",
  "EXCLUSION": "Bilateral fixed and dilated pupils, bleeding diathesis, injury deemed unsurvivable, immediate post-trauma operation that was a decompressive craniectomy (bone flap not replaced after hematoma evacuation)",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design with unblinded treating clinicians introduces potential performance and cointervention bias, although outcome adjudicators were blinded to treatment allocation; High crossover, with more than one-third of medically assigned patients ultimately undergoing decompressive craniectomy, likely diluted differences between randomized groups and complicates interpretation of intention-to-treat effects; Exclusion of patients with withdrawn or invalid consent and additional loss to follow-up in the medical arm create some attrition bias despite sensitivity analyses; Lack of systematic data on long-term sequelae and complications of cranial reconstruction limits understanding of the full procedural risk and late morbidity of decompressive craniectomy; The trial did not evaluate primary decompressive craniectomy, pediatric patients under 10 years, or older patients beyond 65 years, so generalizability to these populations and to primary decompression remains uncertain; The definition of a 'favorable outcome' as GOS-E upper severe disability or better has been criticized as nonstandard and potentially biasing interpretation toward benefit, since conventional dichotomization that excludes upper severe disability yields much smaller differences in favorable outcomes and highlights that many additional survivors remain severely disabled."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a major complication of cirrhosis associated with high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization. Historically, lactulose has been first-line for both treatment and prevention, with rifaximin later established as effective for secondary prophylaxis of recurrent HE. This randomized, double-blind trial specifically addressed whether combination therapy with rifaximin plus lactulose offers superior efficacy over lactulose alone in the acute management of overt HE, demonstrating improved HE reversal, lower in-hospital mortality, and shorter length of stay, and helping to shift practice toward earlier use of rifaximin in more severe episodes.\n\nCurrent liver society guidelines (such as major North American and European hepatology guidelines) recommend lactulose as initial therapy for overt HE and rifaximin as add-on therapy, particularly for prevention of recurrence after an HE episode. While rifaximin is formally approved in many regions for reducing risk of recurrent HE rather than for initial acute treatment, this trial and subsequent randomized studies and meta-analyses support the clinical benefit of adding rifaximin to lactulose in overt HE, especially in more advanced disease. Newer evidence generally confirms improved HE control and reduced rehospitalizations with combination therapy, though consistent mortality benefit and cost-effectiveness remain areas of ongoing evaluation.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Single-center study from India, which may limit generalizability to older and more heterogeneous cirrhotic populations; Relatively small sample size with only 120 participants, limiting power for some secondary and subgroup analyses; Short follow-up restricted to in-hospital outcomes, without data on HE recurrence, long-term survival, or readmissions; Study population was relatively young with very advanced cirrhosis and high-grade HE, so treatment effects may differ in milder disease or different etiologies; Trial focused on clinical endpoints without detailed standardized neurocognitive testing or quality-of-life assessment; Economic impact and cost-effectiveness of routine rifaximin use in this acute setting were not assessed, despite high drug cost; Subsequent evidence and guidelines primarily support rifaximin as add-on therapy for prevention of recurrent HE rather than as standard acute first-line therapy, so the mortality benefit seen here may not be consistently reproducible across settings"

SEPSISPAM addressed whether pushing MAP substantially higher with vasopressors would improve survival, particularly in patients with chronic hypertension who might have a right-shifted autoregulatory curve. The trial demonstrated no mortality benefit of a higher MAP target, while highlighting increased atrial fibrillation and suggesting a renal benefit in the hypertensive subgroup, thereby reinforcing a conservative MAP goal for most patients while opening discussion about individualized targets.\nCurrent sepsis guidelines, including the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations, explicitly endorse an initial MAP target of 65 mm Hg in patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors and cite this trial as key supporting evidence. Subsequent observational data and randomized studies have generally confirmed that routine use of higher MAP targets does not improve survival and may increase cardiovascular complications, though they support considering higher targets in select patients with chronic hypertension or signs of inadequate organ perfusion. Contemporary guidelines do not recommend a uniform higher MAP goal but suggest individualizing blood pressure targets beyond 65 mm Hg based on comorbidities and perfusion markers.",

  "POPULATION_DETAILS": "Adults ≥18 years admitted to one of five participating ICUs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center between June 1, 2015, and April 30, 2017; approximately half admitted from the ED, about one fifth from the operating room, and the remainder from transfers, wards, or outpatient settings; median age 58 years, 57.6% male; more than one third were receiving mechanical ventilation and about one quarter vasopressors at enrollment, with common admission diagnoses including sepsis or septic shock and traumatic brain injury.",
  "INTERVENTION": "Balanced crystalloids for IV isotonic crystalloid administration.",
  "INTERVENTION_DETAILS": "ICUs assigned to the balanced-crystalloids strategy used balanced crystalloids for all intravenous isotonic crystalloid therapy between ICU admission and hospital discharge or day 30, whichever came first. Patients received either lactated Ringer’s solution or Plasma-Lyte A according to the treating clinician’s preference. An electronic order-entry advisor alerted clinicians to the trial, screened for relative contraindications (e.g., hyperkalemia, brain injury), and, when none were present, guided ordering of the assigned balanced crystalloid. Median volume of balanced crystalloids administered from ICU admission through follow-up was 1000 mL (interquartile range 0–3210 mL).",
  "COMPARISON": "0.9% saline for IV isotonic crystalloid administration.",
  "COMPARISON_DETAILS": "ICUs assigned to the saline strategy used 0.9% sodium chloride for all intravenous isotonic crystalloid therapy between ICU admission and hospital discharge or day 30, whichever came first. An electronic order-entry advisor similarly promoted use of saline when no relative contraindications to the assigned fluid were present, with clinicians able to override the assignment. Median volume of 0.9% sodium chloride administered from ICU admission through follow-up was 1020 mL (interquartile range 0–3500 mL).",
  "OUTCOME": "Major adverse kidney event within 30 days (MAKE-30).",
  "OUTCOME_DETAILS": "The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a major adverse kidney event within 30 days (MAKE-30), defined as the composite of death from any cause, new receipt of renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (final inpatient serum creatinine ≥200% of baseline), with events censored at hospital discharge or 30 days after ICU admission, whichever came first. Key secondary outcomes included in-hospital death before ICU discharge, at 30 days, and at 60 days; new renal-replacement therapy; persistent renal dysfunction; stage ≥2 acute kidney injury; and ICU-, ventilator-, vasopressor-, and renal-replacement-therapy–free days over the first 28 days.",
  "INTERVENTION_N": "7942",
  "COMPARISON_N": "7860",
  "ARM_SELECTION_NOTE": "The trial compared two crystalloid strategies for all IV isotonic crystalloid administration—balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer’s solution or Plasma-Lyte A) versus 0.9% saline—so these were directly selected as the intervention and comparator; no additional arms required selection or pooling.",
  "CLINICALQUESTION": "In critically ill adults admitted to ICUs, does default use of balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer’s or Plasma-Lyte A) for IV isotonic fluid administration, compared with 0.9% saline, reduce major adverse kidney events within 30 days?",
  "CLINICALQUESTION_simple": "In critically ill adults, does using balanced crystalloids instead of saline for IV fluids improve kidney outcomes?",
  "BOTTOMLINE": "Among critically ill adults in a single-center ICU system, using balanced crystalloids instead of saline as the default isotonic fluid produced a small but statistically significant reduction in the composite of death, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction at 30 days. Differences in individual kidney outcomes and mortality were modest and not clearly significant, but because balanced crystalloids are inexpensive and appear safe, many clinicians have adopted them as the routine fluid for most ICU patients, particularly those with sepsis or anticipated high crystalloid exposure.",
  "BOTTOMLINE_simple": "In critically ill adults, balanced crystalloids appear to offer a small kidney-related and potential survival advantage over saline and are reasonable as the default IV fluid for most ICU patients.",

  ],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before SMART, 0.9% saline was the dominant crystalloid in ICUs, but preclinical work and observational data raised concerns about hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, AKI, and mortality, and small randomized studies were underpowered to show patient-centered benefits of balanced solutions. SMART, together with the companion SALT-ED trial in noncritically ill adults, provided the first large randomized evidence that shifting the default isotonic fluid from saline to balanced crystalloids could modestly reduce a composite kidney outcome in a broad ICU population, prompting many centers to move toward balanced crystalloids as their standard fluid for most critically ill patients.\n\nCurrent Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 adult guidelines recommend crystalloids as first-line resuscitation fluid and specifically suggest using balanced crystalloids instead of normal saline for adults with sepsis or septic shock, with SMART cited as key supporting evidence. More recent large multicenter RCTs such as BaSICS and PLUS have not shown an overall mortality or AKI advantage of balanced crystalloids over saline, so contemporary practice often favors balanced crystalloids as the default in general ICU and septic populations while still preferring saline in conditions like traumatic brain injury, recognizing that any benefit of balanced solutions is likely small and context dependent.",
  "INCLUSION": "Adults ≥18 y, admission to a participating ICU during the study period",
  "EXCLUSION": "Age <18 y, admission to a non-ICU ward from the emergency department, not admitted to one of the participating ICUs",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Single academic center trial limits generalizability to other hospitals and health systems; Cluster-randomized, unblinded design with group assignment by ICU and calendar month could introduce performance bias and some crossover to non-assigned fluids; Primary endpoint was a composite MAKE-30 outcome combining death, need for new renal-replacement therapy, and persistent creatinine elevation, and the trial did not demonstrate clearly significant differences in the individual kidney components; Absolute risk reduction was small with a borderline p value and numerous secondary and subgroup analyses, raising concern for type I error and overinterpretation of modest effects; Median exposure to study fluid was only about 1 L, so findings may not apply to patients receiving larger-volume resuscitation; Subsequent large multicenter RCTs (such as BaSICS and PLUS) did not show a clear mortality or AKI benefit of balanced crystalloids over saline, suggesting that the effect size observed in SMART may have been overestimated or highly context specific."

  "INTERVENTION": "Intensive antihypertensive therapy targeting SBP <120 mm Hg",
  "INTERVENTION_DETAILS": "Participants randomized to intensive treatment had their antihypertensive regimen adjusted using a prespecified algorithm to target SBP <120 mm Hg. All major antihypertensive classes were available from a study formulary at no cost. Thiazide-type diuretics (preferably chlorthalidone) were encouraged as first-line agents, loop diuretics for advanced CKD, and beta-blockers for CAD; ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (preferably amlodipine) were also commonly used. Medications were titrated monthly initially and then at least every 3 months using the mean of three seated automated office BP measurements, with lifestyle modification encouraged. Achieving the intensive target typically required about one additional antihypertensive drug compared with standard treatment.",
  "COMPARISON": "Standard antihypertensive therapy targeting SBP <140 mm Hg",
  "COMPARISON_DETAILS": "Participants in the standard-treatment group had antihypertensive therapy adjusted to target SBP 135–139 mm Hg using the same drug classes and algorithms, with dose reduction if SBP was <130 mm Hg at a single visit or <135 mm Hg at two consecutive visits. BP was measured with the same standardized automated office protocol as in the intensive arm, and visits occurred monthly for the first 3 months and then every 3 months. Lifestyle modification was similarly encouraged. This strategy usually used fewer medications (around two agents on average) than the intensive-treatment strategy.",

  "CLINICALQUESTION_simple": "In high-risk adults with hypertension, does targeting SBP <120 mm Hg versus <140 mm Hg improve cardiovascular outcomes?",
  "BOTTOMLINE": "In adults ≥50 yr with hypertension and elevated CV risk but without diabetes or prior stroke, targeting SBP <120 mm Hg rather than <140 mm Hg significantly reduced the composite of MI, other ACS, stroke, HF, or CV death and also lowered all-cause mortality. These benefits came at the cost of more hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury, so intensive BP targets are best applied to carefully selected patients with close monitoring.",

  ],
  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before SPRINT, most evidence in hypertension focused on achieving SBP targets below about 150 mm Hg, and uncertainty remained about whether more intensive SBP lowering conferred additional benefit in older, high-risk adults without diabetes. SPRINT directly addressed this gap by randomizing such patients to standardized SBP targets of <120 vs <140 mm Hg and demonstrated clear reductions in major CV events and all-cause mortality with the lower target, at the expense of more adverse events, thereby shifting the field toward more aggressive BP control in selected populations.\n\nThese results have been incorporated into contemporary guidelines, including the ACC/AHA 2017 hypertension guideline and subsequent updates, the ESC/ESH 2018 guideline, and KDIGO guidance for CKD, which generally recommend SBP targets <130 mm Hg for many high-risk adults and suggest that SBP levels approaching 120 mm Hg are reasonable when BP is measured with standardized techniques similar to SPRINT. Subsequent meta-analyses and follow-up studies have largely confirmed the cardiovascular benefits of intensive SBP lowering while highlighting the increased risk of AKI and other adverse events, so current recommendations emphasize individualizing targets, especially in frail older patients and those with CKD, rather than universally applying an SBP <120 mm Hg goal.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥50 yr, SBP 130–180 mm Hg on 0–4 antihypertensive medications, increased CV risk (clinical or subclinical CVD other than stroke, CKD with eGFR 20–59 ml/min/1.73 m2, 10-yr Framingham CVD risk ≥15%, or age ≥75 yr)",
  "EXCLUSION": "Diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or TIA, known secondary hypertension, standing SBP <110 mm Hg, significant proteinuria, polycystic kidney disease, eGFR <20 ml/min/1.73 m2 or ESRD, symptomatic HF within 6 mo or LVEF <35%, recent (within 3 mo) major CV event or procedure or unstable angina hospitalization, organ transplant, serious comorbidity with life expectancy <3 yr or recent non–skin cancer malignancy, conditions likely to limit adherence, pregnancy or high risk of pregnancy",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Open-label design with only blinded outcome adjudication, raising potential for performance or ascertainment bias; Early termination after a median 3.26 yr follow-up may overestimate the magnitude of benefit and limited assessment of long-term renal and cognitive outcomes; Restricted population (no diabetes, prior stroke, very advanced CKD, or institutionalized very old adults) limits generalizability to many common hypertensive groups; Use of highly standardized automated office BP measurements means that the SBP <120 mm Hg target may not correspond directly to usual clinic readings in routine practice; Achieving the intensive target required more medications, visits, and monitoring, raising feasibility and cost concerns if broadly implemented; Higher rates of hypotension, syncope, electrolyte disturbances, and acute kidney injury in the intensive arm highlight safety concerns, particularly for frail patients or those with CKD."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before STAMPEDE, most evidence that bariatric (metabolic) surgery could improve or remit T2DM came from observational cohorts and a small randomized trial of gastric banding in less advanced diabetes. STAMPEDE was one of the first randomized trials to directly compare modern intensive medical therapy with contemporary procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy in patients with more severe, longstanding T2DM, demonstrating markedly superior glycemic control, greater weight loss, and reduced medication requirements with surgery. Alongside a contemporaneous trial comparing surgery to conventional therapy in more severely obese patients, it helped shift the concept of bariatric surgery toward “metabolic surgery” for diabetes management rather than weight loss alone.\n\nSubsequent longer-term follow-up from STAMPEDE and other randomized and cohort studies has confirmed that metabolic surgery provides durable improvements in glycemic control, weight, and cardiometabolic risk factors for many patients, although some attenuation over time and late complications can occur. Current guidelines, including the American Diabetes Association Standards of Care and joint bariatric/metabolic surgery guidelines from professional societies, now recommend metabolic surgery as a treatment option for appropriate patients with T2DM and obesity (generally BMI ≥35 kg/m², and in some guidelines BMI 30–34.9 kg/m² if hyperglycemia remains uncontrolled despite optimal medical therapy), explicitly citing evidence consistent with STAMPEDE. These guidelines also emphasize the need to balance the clear metabolic benefits against perioperative and long-term surgical risks, ongoing nutritional monitoring, and patient preference.",

Current obesity and cardiometabolic guidelines (e.g., contemporary AACE/ACE obesity guidelines, Endocrine Society obesity pharmacotherapy guidance, and ADA Standards of Care) now highlight semaglutide 2.4 mg as a high-efficacy anti-obesity medication for adults with BMI ≥30 or ≥27 with weight-related comorbidities, recommend its use as long-term therapy alongside lifestyle modification, and emphasize careful monitoring for gastrointestinal and gallbladder-related adverse events; guidelines do not recommend it for patients with type 1 diabetes or a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, reflecting trial exclusions and class-specific warnings.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Trial duration was limited to 68 weeks, so long-term safety and durability of weight loss on continuous semaglutide beyond about 1.5 years were initially uncertain, and separate extension data showed substantial weight regain after treatment withdrawal; The study population was predominantly White and female and excluded patients with diabetes, severe psychiatric disease, prior bariatric surgery, and significant renal or hepatic impairment, which limits generalizability to broader and more diverse obesity populations; All participants received structured, frequent lifestyle counselling in a tightly controlled trial setting, which may overestimate real-world adherence and weight-loss effectiveness achievable in routine practice; Semaglutide was associated with frequent gastrointestinal adverse events, a modestly higher rate of serious adverse events, and a signal for increased gallbladder and hepatobiliary complications, raising tolerability and safety considerations in some patients; The trial was sponsored, designed, and largely conducted by the drug manufacturer, introducing potential risk of sponsor bias despite randomized double-blind methodology and robust statistical analysis."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this trial, guidelines for complicated intraabdominal infection from professional societies generally recommended 4–7 days of antimicrobial therapy after adequate source control, yet real-world practice often extended therapy to 10–14 days, guided by resolution of systemic inflammatory signs. The STOP-IT trial directly tested a fixed short course versus a traditional clinically guided longer course and showed that limiting antimicrobial therapy to approximately 4 days after source control did not worsen key infectious outcomes while substantially reducing antibiotic exposure, reinforcing antimicrobial stewardship efforts in surgical infections.\nSubsequent guidelines, including the Surgical Infection Society 2017 recommendations and global emergency surgery guidance such as the 2017 WSES intraabdominal infection guidelines, have incorporated these findings by endorsing short-course (about 3–5 or up to 4 days) postoperative antibiotic regimens after adequate source control. More recent observational and secondary analyses have confirmed that even patients presenting with sepsis do not require longer antimicrobial courses if source control is achieved, and current IDSA/SIS and WSES-aligned recommendations generally support short, fixed-duration therapy in this setting, with longer courses reserved for inadequate source control or persistent signs of ongoing infection.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥16 years, complicated intraabdominal infection, operative or percutaneous procedure achieving adequate source control, temperature ≥38°C or leukocytosis ≥11,000/mm3 or gastrointestinal dysfunction/ileus preventing intake of >50% normal diet",
  "EXCLUSION": "Lack of adequate source control, high likelihood of death within 72 hours of initial intervention, planned relaparotomy, perforated gastric or duodenal ulcer treated within 24 hours of symptom onset, traumatic or iatrogenic bowel injury treated within 12 hours, non-perforated non-gangrenous appendicitis, non-perforated non-gangrenous cholecystitis, gangrenous appendicitis or peritonitis without positive cultures or with sterile cultures, ischemic or necrotic intestine without perforation or positive cultures, intraabdominal infection with active necrotizing pancreatitis (without abscess or infected pseudocyst), primary spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, intraabdominal infection associated with an indwelling peritoneal dialysis catheter, primary skin closure of a laparotomy incision in the presence of diffuse nonlocalized peritonitis, pregnancy, concurrent infection requiring more than 4 days of antimicrobial therapy",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Trial stopped early at approximately half the planned sample size due to funding withdrawal, reducing power to detect smaller differences; protocol adherence was incomplete (particularly in the control arm), raising the possibility of dilution of any true treatment effect; time to diagnosis of surgical-site and recurrent intraabdominal infections was significantly longer in the longer-course group, potentially reflecting detection bias; definition of ileus was somewhat vague and multifactorial, which may limit the precision of the clinically guided strategy; study population had relatively low APACHE II scores and low mortality, limiting generalizability to more critically ill or high-risk patients; intraoperative cultures were encouraged but not mandatory, so microbiologic characterization and resistance outcomes are incomplete; adequacy of source control was judged by local investigators rather than by a standardized multidisciplinary assessment, which may introduce variability; adverse events specifically attributable to antimicrobial therapy (e.g., nephrotoxicity, drug reactions) were not systematically reported, limiting assessment of safety trade-offs."

  "OUTCOME_DETAILS": "The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 28 days, analyzed for prednisolone versus no prednisolone and pentoxifylline versus no pentoxifylline using the margins of the 2×2 factorial design.

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before STOPAH, management of severe alcoholic hepatitis was inconsistent: corticosteroids were commonly used based on small heterogeneous trials and meta-analyses suggesting short-term benefit, and pentoxifylline was recommended by some guidelines mainly to prevent hepatorenal syndrome, despite limited and conflicting data. STOPAH was the first large, well-powered, pragmatic trial to evaluate both prednisolone and pentoxifylline in a factorial design; it convincingly showed no benefit of pentoxifylline and only a borderline, non-significant reduction in 28-day mortality with prednisolone, while clearly demonstrating increased serious infections, thereby reshaping the risk–benefit discussion and effectively eliminating pentoxifylline from routine use.\n\nSubsequent evidence and major guidelines, including the American College of Gastroenterology alcoholic liver disease guideline and European liver society guidelines, have incorporated STOPAH by no longer recommending pentoxifylline for severe alcoholic hepatitis and by continuing to endorse prednisolone 40 mg daily for 28 days in carefully selected patients with severe disease (such as Maddrey DF ≥32) without uncontrolled infection or active GI bleeding. More recent studies and meta-analyses generally confirm that steroids may confer a modest short-term survival advantage at the cost of higher infection risk, and guidelines emphasize early response assessment (for example using Lille score) and aggressive infection surveillance rather than abandoning corticosteroids altogether.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age ≥18 y, clinical diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis, history of heavy ongoing or recent alcohol use, jaundice and liver dysfunction consistent with alcoholic hepatitis, Maddrey discriminant function ≥32, hospitalization at participating center",
  "EXCLUSION": "Uncontrolled active GI bleeding, untreated or uncontrolled infection at screening, hepatorenal syndrome or severe renal failure not stabilized, strong contraindication to corticosteroids or pentoxifylline, alternative primary liver disease (such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune or metabolic liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma), pregnancy",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis was largely clinical without routine biopsy, introducing potential misclassification and heterogeneity; Primary endpoint for both drugs was formally negative, yet post hoc emphasis on a borderline prednisolone effect raised concerns about overinterpretation; Factorial design assumed no interaction between prednisolone and pentoxifylline and was not powered to detect treatment interactions; Increased serious infections with prednisolone highlight safety concerns and may have attenuated any potential mortality benefit; Some commentators have questioned whether the lack of a steroid taper and the inclusion of particularly high-risk patients might have influenced outcomes; Subsequent editorials have noted that STOPAH, while definitive for pentoxifylline, leaves residual uncertainty about the true magnitude and duration of benefit from corticosteroids and about optimal patient selection."

  "BOTTOMLINE": "In adults with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk, adding once-weekly semaglutide to standard care reduced major adverse cardiovascular events compared with placebo over a median of about 2 years, driven mainly by fewer nonfatal strokes and, to a lesser extent, nonfatal MIs, while cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were not significantly changed.

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Following regulatory requirements that new T2DM drugs demonstrate cardiovascular safety, SUSTAIN-6 was designed primarily as a noninferiority CV outcomes trial for once-weekly semaglutide in patients with T2DM at high CV risk. The trial not only confirmed CV safety but also showed a clinically meaningful reduction in 3-point MACE, alongside weight loss and better glycemic control, helping to establish semaglutide and other GLP-1 receptor agonists as agents with cardioprotective potential rather than just glucose-lowering drugs.\n\nSubsequent evidence, including PIONEER-6 (oral semaglutide) and large outcome trials such as SELECT in people with overweight/obesity and established CVD, has reinforced the CV benefits of semaglutide and extended its relevance beyond traditional diabetes populations. Contemporary guidelines (for example, ADA Standards of Care, ACC/AHA consensus documents on diabetes and CVD, and KDIGO guidance for diabetes in CKD) now recommend GLP-1 receptor agonists with proven CV benefit, including semaglutide, for T2DM patients with established ASCVD and/or CKD, and later data have generally strengthened SUSTAIN-6’s conclusions while underscoring the need to monitor for diabetic retinopathy when glycemic control improves rapidly.",
  "INCLUSION": "T2DM, age ≥50 years with established CVD, HF (NYHA II–III), or CKD stage ≥3, or age ≥60 years with subclinical vascular disease or risk markers (persistent microalbuminuria/proteinuria, LVH, LV systolic/diastolic dysfunction, ABI<0.9), HbA1c ≥7.0% at screening, anti-diabetic drug naïve or on ≤2 oral agents with or without basal or premixed insulin",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "The primary composite outcome was driven largely by a reduction in nonfatal stroke, with no significant effect on cardiovascular death or nonfatal MI, raising concerns about limited power for individual components; The enriched enrollment of patients with established CVD and/or CKD means the results may not generalize to lower-risk T2DM populations; Background antihyperglycemic regimens and treatment intensification were left to investigators and may have differed between groups, potentially confounding some microvascular and safety outcomes; Fixed maintenance doses of semaglutide (0.5 mg vs 1.0 mg) without treat-to-target titration may have underdosed some individuals who would otherwise receive more intensive GLP-1 RA therapy in practice; The noninferiority design and relatively short median follow-up of about 2.1 years limit conclusions about long-term durability of benefit and rare safety events; The increased incidence of diabetic retinopathy complications, likely related at least in part to rapid glycemic improvement in high-risk eyes, was not fully explained and raised safety concerns that require ongoing monitoring and further study."

TRAPS specifically targeted this highest-risk APS subgroup in a rigorous randomized design and showed clear excess arterial thrombosis and composite events with rivaroxaban compared with well-managed warfarin, overturning the assumption that DOACs are interchangeable with VKAs in this setting and sharply curbing enthusiasm for rivaroxaban in high-risk APS.\n\nSince TRAPS, multiple reviews and position statements, together with a 2-year follow-up analysis of the TRAPS cohort, have reinforced that continued DOAC use in these patients is associated with more thrombotic events than warfarin. The 2019 EULAR recommendations for APS management explicitly advise long-term VKA therapy (INR 2–3, or higher for arterial events) and state that rivaroxaban should not be used in triple-positive APS; ASH 2020 VTE guidelines highlight APS as an exception to the general preference for DOACs; and ISTH 2020 guidance similarly recommends avoiding DOACs in high-risk or triple-positive APS, considering them only in carefully selected lower-risk venous APS when VKAs cannot be used. Overall, contemporary guidelines and expert reviews treat TRAPS as pivotal evidence supporting warfarin over DOACs in high-risk thrombotic APS.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age 18–75 years, definite thrombotic APS, persistent triple aPL positivity (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG/IgM, anti-β2GPI IgG/IgM of the same isotype at medium-to-high titer), history of objectively proven arterial, venous, or biopsy-proven microthrombosis",
  "EXCLUSION": "Severe hypersensitivity to rivaroxaban, creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, current pregnancy or breastfeeding or planned pregnancy without effective contraception, need for other systemic anticoagulants (UFH, LMWH, fondaparinux, other oral anticoagulants) that could not be switched to study drugs, concomitant therapy with strong CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals, HIV protease inhibitors) or strong inducers (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St John’s wort) when alternatives could not be used, major surgery or trauma within 30 days, clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months, history of intracranial, intraocular, spinal, or atraumatic intra-articular bleeding, chronic hemorrhagic disorders, known intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm, planned invasive procedures with high bleeding risk, sustained uncontrolled hypertension with systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg, known liver cirrhosis or alanine aminotransferase >3× upper limit of normal",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Trial was stopped early after only 120 of a planned 536 patients were enrolled, resulting in a small sample size, few events, and wide confidence intervals for treatment effects; Open-label design could introduce performance and detection bias despite blinded central adjudication of outcomes; Study population was restricted to high-risk, triple-positive APS patients treated in Italian centers, limiting generalizability to lower-risk APS phenotypes, non–triple-positive profiles, or other geographic and practice settings; Because the study was designed as a noninferiority trial but terminated prematurely, the planned noninferiority hypothesis could not be fully tested and the observed magnitude of harm with rivaroxaban may be imprecise; The composite primary endpoint combined efficacy (thromboembolism and vascular death) and safety (major bleeding), which can complicate interpretation of the net clinical effect of rivaroxaban vs warfarin; Mechanistic explanations for rivaroxaban’s apparent failure to prevent arterial events in APS remain speculative and were not directly examined within the trial; Small numbers of patients receiving concomitant agents such as aspirin or hydroxychloroquine precluded robust assessment of whether these therapies modify the relative safety or efficacy of rivaroxaban vs warfarin."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Perioperative transfusion practice in cardiac surgery has historically been liberal because of concerns about anemia-induced myocardial and other organ ischemia, despite accumulating ICU data supporting restrictive thresholds in other critically ill populations. TRICS III was a large, methodologically robust, international randomized trial specifically in moderate-to-high risk on-pump cardiac surgery patients that demonstrated a hemoglobin threshold of 7.5 g/dL is safe and reduces transfusion exposure compared with more liberal thresholds, helping to resolve uncertainty created by smaller, earlier cardiac surgery studies.\n\nSubsequent guidelines, including the 2016 AABB red blood cell transfusion guideline and the 2023 AABB international guidelines, incorporate TRICS III and related evidence in recommending restrictive strategies for most hemodynamically stable adults, with cardiac surgery specifically cited as a setting where thresholds around 7.5–8 g/dL are appropriate. Contemporary cardiac surgery and patient blood management guidelines similarly endorse restrictive, hemoglobin-based transfusion triggers rather than routine liberal transfusion, and newer data have largely confirmed that restrictive thresholds do not worsen survival or major morbidity in this setting while supporting stewardship of blood resources.",

TRISS directly tested whether patients with septic shock truly benefit from higher hemoglobin thresholds and showed no survival or ischemic advantage to a liberal strategy, helping dispel the assumption that septic shock requires higher Hb targets than other critical illnesses and extending restrictive transfusion evidence into this high-risk group.\n\nCurrent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, as well as contemporary AABB red blood cell transfusion guidelines, recommend a restrictive transfusion threshold of approximately 7 g/dL for hemodynamically stable critically ill adults, including those with sepsis and septic shock, in the absence of active bleeding or acute coronary syndrome. Subsequent observational data and randomized trials in other ICU populations have generally confirmed the safety of restrictive thresholds, and no major randomized evidence has overturned the main conclusion of TRISS. Guidelines continue to endorse restrictive transfusion in septic shock while highlighting that the trial excluded patients with active bleeding or myocardial ischemia, for whom individualized decisions and higher thresholds may still be appropriate.",

However, these studies were relatively small, focused mainly on shockable rhythms, and left uncertainty about the optimal temperature and whether deeper hypothermia was necessary. The TTM trial was designed as a large, pragmatic comparison of two actively controlled temperature targets, 33°C versus 36°C, to determine whether deeper hypothermia was superior when both groups received strict temperature management and fever prevention.\n\nFollowing this trial, resuscitation guidelines such as the European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine recommendations and the American Heart Association guidelines shifted from promoting a specific hypothermia target of 32–34°C toward recommending active targeted temperature management in the broader range of approximately 32–36°C, with a strong emphasis on avoiding fever. Subsequent trials, including those comparing 33°C hypothermia with normothermia plus aggressive fever prevention, have generally confirmed a lack of clear benefit for deeper hypothermia while reinforcing the importance of strict temperature control. Current guidelines highlight active temperature management and fever avoidance after cardiac arrest, and while they allow either 33°C or 36°C as acceptable targets, they no longer favor deeper hypothermia based on available evidence, including the TTM trial.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Both groups received active temperature control with rigorous fever prevention, so the trial could not determine the benefit of targeted temperature management versus no temperature control; the study was powered to detect only moderate differences in outcomes, so smaller but potentially clinically relevant benefits or harms of 33°C versus 36°C cannot be excluded; generalizability is limited because patients were predominantly out-of-hospital arrests of presumed cardiac cause treated in experienced centers, with less representation of in-hospital arrests, non-cardiac etiologies, or resource-limited settings; there was no true normothermia or permissive-fever arm, so the findings address relative effects of two hypothermia strategies rather than establishing whether any hypothermia is necessary; intensive sedation, neuromuscular blockade, and standardized prognostication protocols might differ from real-world practice and could influence withdrawal-of-care decisions and functional outcomes"

Subsequent work, including the earlier TTM trial comparing 33°C vs 36°C, raised doubts about whether deep hypothermia itself or simply avoidance of fever was responsible for benefit; the large, methodologically rigorous TTM2 trial was designed as a definitive comparison and showed that 33°C confers no advantage over active normothermia while increasing arrhythmias, prompting many centers to move away from routine deep hypothermia.\n\nCurrent resuscitation guidance reflects these findings: European Resuscitation Council and intensive care society guidelines initially recommended TTM with a target between 32°C and 36°C for at least 24 hours in comatose post-arrest adults, but updated ERC-ESICM temperature-control guidance now emphasizes continuous core temperature monitoring and active prevention of fever (>37.7°C) for at least 72 hours, without favoring routine cooling to 33°C in unselected patients. American Heart Association resuscitation guidelines and a subsequent science advisory similarly recommend deliberate temperature control within a broad range (roughly 32–37.5°C) with strong focus on fever avoidance, acknowledging that large trials and meta-analyses including TTM2 have not demonstrated mortality or functional benefit from deep hypothermia; ongoing research is exploring whether specific subgroups might still benefit and how best to implement pragmatic temperature management.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "No arm without active temperature management, so the study cannot determine whether any TTM strategy is superior to no temperature control; Treating clinicians were unblinded to temperature targets, introducing potential performance bias despite blinded prognostication and outcome assessment; A high degree of protocolized deep sedation, mechanical ventilation, and resource-intensive device-based cooling may limit generalizability to centers with different post-arrest practices or fewer resources; Nearly half of patients in the normothermia arm required cooling devices to prevent fever, narrowing the temperature difference between groups and potentially diluting any incremental effect of hypothermia; The trial excluded some very high-risk groups (such as unwitnessed asystolic arrests and patients with severe chronic lung disease on home oxygen), so results may not apply to all post-arrest populations; Some patients were coenrolled in other interventional studies, which could interact with temperature management and modestly complicate interpretation of treatment effects."

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this study, evidence from critical care and other populations suggested that restrictive transfusion thresholds were at least as safe as liberal strategies, but patients with acute GI bleeding had been underrepresented, and guidelines offered inconsistent or vague recommendations on transfusion triggers. This trial provided the first large, prospective, randomized evidence in acute upper GI bleeding, demonstrating that a restrictive strategy not only conserved blood products but also improved mortality, rebleeding, and adverse events compared with a liberal strategy, and it was widely regarded as practice-changing, especially for patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.\n\nSubsequent guidelines such as ACG and international nonvariceal UGIB recommendations, as well as portal hypertension and variceal bleeding guidance documents (including more recent consensus statements like Baveno and hepatology society guidelines), now endorse a generally restrictive transfusion threshold around 7 g/dL for most hospitalized UGIB patients, with higher thresholds reserved for selected groups (for example, those with active exsanguinating hemorrhage or acute coronary syndrome). Later RCTs and meta-analyses in GI bleeding and broader hospitalized populations have largely confirmed the safety and benefit of restrictive transfusion, so this trial’s conclusions remain aligned with current guideline-based practice.",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Single-center study in a Spanish tertiary hospital with rapid access to endoscopy, which may limit generalizability to settings with delayed endoscopy or different resources; Unblinded transfusion strategy with potential for performance bias despite concealed randomization; Extensive exclusion criteria (including massive exsanguinating bleeding and acute coronary syndrome) limit applicability to the sickest or most complex UGIB patients; Protocol deviations occurred, with some patients in the restrictive group transfused above the hemoglobin threshold and some in the liberal group not transfused when below threshold, potentially diluting or distorting the treatment effect; Subgroup analyses (for example, Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis, specific bleeding etiologies) were underpowered, so benefits of a restrictive strategy in these high-risk subgroups remain uncertain"

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before VA-NEPHRON D, ACEi and ARB monotherapy were each known to slow progression of diabetic nephropathy, and small studies plus surrogate endpoints suggested that dual renin-angiotensin system blockade might further reduce proteinuria and potentially improve long-term renal outcomes. VA-NEPHRON D tested whether adding lisinopril to losartan in high-risk T2DM with overt nephropathy would translate greater proteinuria reduction into fewer hard renal events but instead showed no renal or mortality benefit and more serious adverse events, reinforcing signals from earlier high-risk populations that dual blockade is harmful.\n\nCurrent CKD and diabetes guidelines, including recent KDIGO and ADA recommendations, advise use of a single maximally tolerated ACEi or ARB (but not both together) for albuminuric diabetic CKD and explicitly discourage routine dual ACEi/ARB therapy because of the increased risk of hyperkalemia and AKI observed in trials such as VA-NEPHRON D, ONTARGET, and ALTITUDE. Subsequent evidence has confirmed that while dual blockade can reduce albuminuria, it does not improve survival or kidney failure outcomes and increases adverse events, so guideline-directed therapy continues to favor single-agent RAAS blockade with additional renoprotective strategies (e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors, nonsteroidal MRAs) rather than ACEi+ARB combinations.",
  "INCLUSION": "Adults with T2DM, eGFR 30.0–89.9 ml/min/1.73 m2, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥300 mg/g, able to tolerate losartan 100 mg/day during run-in, blood pressure suitable for ACEi/ARB-based therapy",
  "EXCLUSION": "Nondiabetic kidney disease, serum potassium >5.5 mmol/L, current treatment with sodium polystyrene sulfonate, inability to stop medications that increase hyperkalemia risk, known contraindication or intolerance to ACEi or ARB, clinical conditions making participation unsafe per investigators",
  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Trial was terminated early due to excess hyperkalemia and AKI in the combination arm, reducing statistical power and limiting assessment of long-term renal outcomes; Primary endpoint relied on changes in serum creatinine–based eGFR rather than directly measured GFR, making it a surrogate that can be influenced by non-GFR factors; Use of serum creatinine and estimated GFR as endpoints may be confounded by effects of ACEi/ARB therapy on creatinine handling and by changes in muscle mass; BP was assessed by office measurements rather than more precise 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, potentially obscuring between-group BP differences; Study population consisted mainly of older male veterans, which may limit generalizability to women and non-veteran or younger populations; All participants received losartan, so the trial cannot address outcomes versus no RAAS blockade and comparisons are restricted to dual therapy versus ARB monotherapy"

  "POPULATION": "Adults 18–80 years with acute ischemic stroke of unknown onset (often wake-up stroke) who were outside the standard 4.5-hour time window from last known well but had a DWI–FLAIR mismatch on MRI and otherwise met eligibility for IV thrombolysis.",
  "POPULATION_DETAILS": "Patients presented with clinical signs of acute ischemic stroke and had been able to carry out usual daily activities without support before the event (pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale 0–1). Stroke onset time was unknown because symptoms were recognized on awakening from sleep or were unwitnessed (e.g., due to aphasia or confusion). The interval from last known well to planned treatment initiation had to be >4.5 hours, with no upper limit, to ensure that patients were beyond the conventional time-based alteplase window. All patients underwent acute MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging, FLAIR, hemorrhage-sensitive sequences, and time-of-flight MRA; eligibility required a visible acute ischemic lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging with no corresponding parenchymal hyperintensity on FLAIR (DWI–FLAIR mismatch) in the region of the acute stroke. Median baseline NIHSS was 6, reflecting predominantly mild to moderate deficits.",
  "INTERVENTION": "MRI-guided IV alteplase 0.9 mg/kg",
  "INTERVENTION_DETAILS": "Patients randomized to the intervention received IV alteplase at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg body weight, with 10% of the dose given as an initial bolus and the remaining 90% infused over 60 minutes. Treatment was initiated after MRI confirmed a DWI–FLAIR mismatch (acute ischemic lesion visible on diffusion-weighted imaging without corresponding FLAIR hyperintensity) and within a median of about 3.1 hours from symptom recognition, but more than 4.5 hours from last known well. Concomitant treatments and monitoring followed standard acute stroke care per European and national guidelines.",
  "COMPARISON": "MRI-guided IV placebo",
  "COMPARISON_DETAILS": "Patients in the control arm received a matching IV placebo using the same bolus plus 60-minute infusion schedule as alteplase, after the same MRI-based DWI–FLAIR mismatch selection and within similar time windows from symptom recognition and last known well. All other aspects of acute stroke care, including blood pressure management and secondary prevention, followed standard-of-care guidelines at participating centers.",
  "OUTCOME": "Favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0–1) at 90 days",
  "OUTCOME_DETAILS": "The primary efficacy outcome was a favorable functional outcome at 90 days, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 or 1. Key secondary efficacy outcomes included the full ordinal distribution of mRS scores at 90 days (shift analysis), a composite global outcome score integrating mRS, NIHSS, Barthel Index, and Glasgow Outcome Scale, and patient-reported quality-of-life measures (Beck Depression Inventory and EQ-5D) at 90 days, as well as MRI infarct volume at 22–36 hours.

  "BOTTOMLINE": "In patients with acute ischemic stroke of unknown onset selected by MRI DWI–FLAIR mismatch, IV alteplase modestly increased the proportion achieving functional independence at 90 days compared with placebo, with a beneficial shift in overall disability scores.

  "CLINICALCONTEXT": "Before this trial, patients with wake-up or otherwise unwitnessed ischemic stroke were generally excluded from IV thrombolysis because time from onset could not be confirmed to be within the established 4.5-hour window, despite observational data suggesting many such strokes occur shortly before awakening. MRI patterns showing a DWI–FLAIR mismatch had been proposed as a surrogate marker of recent infarction, but there was limited randomized evidence that using this imaging “tissue clock” to guide treatment actually improved outcomes. WAKE-UP provided the first robust randomized, placebo-controlled evidence that MRI-guided alteplase in this population can improve functional independence, helping to shift practice from a purely time-based to a tissue-based approach in selected unknown-onset strokes.\n\nSubsequent guidelines, including the 2019 AHA/ASA acute ischemic stroke guideline update and later European Stroke Organisation recommendations, explicitly endorse standard-dose IV alteplase in carefully selected patients with wake-up or unclear-onset stroke who demonstrate a DWI–FLAIR mismatch and otherwise meet thrombolysis criteria. Later trials and pooled analyses of imaging-selected, extended-window thrombolysis have generally supported the safety and efficacy of this strategy, although data remain more limited than for conventional time-based thrombolysis, and MRI access may constrain implementation. Modern guidelines emphasize that WAKE-UP-type MRI selection is reasonable where available, while centers without emergent MRI may rely on CT-based perfusion or continue to withhold thrombolysis in unknown-onset cases outside standard time windows, particularly in patients with severe strokes or large-vessel occlusion who are candidates for mechanical thrombectomy.",
  "INCLUSION": "Age 18–80 years, clinical signs of acute ischemic stroke, able to perform usual daily activities independently before stroke (pre-stroke mRS 0–1), wake-up or otherwise unwitnessed stroke with unknown onset time (e.g., recognized on awakening, aphasia, or confusion), last known well >4.5 hours before planned treatment, treatment initiation feasible within 4.5 hours of symptom recognition, MRI showing acute ischemic lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging with no corresponding hyperintensity on FLAIR (DWI–FLAIR mismatch), non-severe neurologic deficit (NIHSS not >25), suitable for IV alteplase by standard clinical criteria aside from unknown onset time",

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Trial was stopped early because of funding cessation, enrolling 503 instead of the planned 800 patients, which reduced statistical power and left wide confidence intervals around key outcomes; Imaging eligibility required MRI with DWI–FLAIR mismatch, which limited enrollment to a minority of screened unknown-onset stroke patients and restricts generalizability to centers without ready emergency MRI access; Participants had predominantly mild to moderate deficits (median NIHSS 6) and severe strokes (NIHSS >25) or large infarcts were excluded, so results may not apply to patients with more severe presentations or large-vessel occlusions; The DWI–FLAIR mismatch criterion has imperfect sensitivity for identifying strokes within 4.5 hours, meaning some truly eligible patients may be excluded and some treated patients may be beyond the biologically optimal window; Mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were numerically higher in the alteplase arm, and the trial was underpowered to precisely characterize these safety risks; Many secondary efficacy outcomes were not adjusted for multiple comparisons and thus cannot be used for definitive hypothesis testing, limiting inferences beyond the primary endpoint."

WARFASA was one of the first randomized trials to test whether low-dose aspirin, begun after a finite course of warfarin, could provide a simpler, lower-bleeding alternative for secondary prevention of VTE, showing a moderate reduction in recurrence without excess major bleeding and helping to establish aspirin as a potential step-down strategy for patients who discontinue anticoagulants.\nCurrent VTE guidelines, including iterations of the CHEST antithrombotic therapy guidelines and the ASH VTE guidelines, acknowledge aspirin as an option for secondary prevention in patients with unprovoked VTE who stop anticoagulation, largely informed by WARFASA together with ASPIRE, though they generally prefer extended-phase anticoagulation with DOACs when bleeding risk is acceptable.

  "LIMITATION_CRITICISM": "Slow enrollment led to extension of the study over several years and reduced efficiency; modest sample size and event rates limited power for detecting differences in arterial events and mortality; predominantly white, regionally concentrated population limits generalizability; exclusion of patients with cancer, thrombophilia, or higher bleeding risk reduces applicability to many real-world VTE patients; comparison with placebo rather than extended anticoagulation does not directly inform decisions between aspirin and ongoing DOAC or VKA therapy; open-label management after study treatment and potential post-trial antithrombotic use could introduce bias in longer-term outcomes"
